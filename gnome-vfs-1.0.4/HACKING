Please send patches to gnome-vfs@ximian.com with detailed
ChangeLog entires for review before committing, and get approval from
Ian McKellar. Please send to the list and not to anyone directly so
all Gnome VFS hackers have the opportunity to comment. 

Please do not check in changes without approval.

Please do not check in changes without a ChangeLog entry. 

All ChangeLog entries go into the root ChangeLog except for entries for
changes in the po and data/mime directories.

Please make sure components that depend on Gnome VFS (eg Nautilus, Evolution) 
do not break with your change or arrange that an update to the dependent
components gets submitted at the same time. 

Please use a coding style that is consistent with the existing Gnome VFS code.
Gnome VFS uses the GNOME Programming Guidelines with 8-space tabs and a
"K&R" indentation style.

Make sure all of your new code compiles without any warnings.

Do not turn any warnings off, do not turn -Werror off in configure.in. If you 
have problems with the existing warnings building on your environment, please 
contact the maintainers.

Make sure your changes are properly tested, ammong other things run a "make 
check".

Use "FIXME" to augument code that needs more work, that is missing 
functionality or in general needs attention. Include a comprehensive comment 
explaining what is missing, why you think something is broken, what you 
suggest as a fix, etc.  FIXME entries are periodically converted into bugzilla 
bugs.  Do not use any other format to draw attention to problems, comments 
that do not contain "FIXME" are not going to be found by our problem tracking 
tools.

GnomeVFS bugs and open tasks are tracked in bugzilla.gnome.org

For IRC help/feedback use irc.gnome.org/#nautilus.
