    <title>Uses and Purpose</title>
    <para>
      GnomeVFS is a filesystem abstraction library allowing applications
      plugable transparent access to a variety of "real" filesystems, from
      WebDAV to digital cameras, to the local filesystem. It also contains
      a number of other convenient file utilities such as a comphrehensive
      MIME database / Application registry, and a copy engine. Use of GnomeVFS
      ensures that an application or component will be usable by Nautilus
      or other GnomeVFS applications for handling the display of data from
      various URIs, as well

      <title>User's Perspective</title>
      <para>
	From a user's perspective GnomeVFS enabled applications provide consistent
	access to their data, whether it be stored on remote servers or on their
	local harddisk, or even a peripheral device such as a Rio or a digital
	camera. Rather than having to work around the distinction between storage
	you can work off of and storage you can only "download" from or "upload" to,
	GnomeVFS allows users to store their documents and data wherever it is
	most convenient.

      <title>Developer's Perspective</title>
      <para>
	Besides providing transparent access to data methods that you might
	otherwise have to implement, GnomeVFS provides a number of convenience
	libraries for processing URIs, detecting the MIME type of files, and
	even figuring out which applications or components to launch to view
	a file or what icon to use. Writing a GnomeVFS module may also be an
	appropriate solution to some data access problems as it allows the
	developer to implement a relatively small number of functions to gain
	general filesystem semantics (and of course, writing a GnomeVFS module
	benefits other applications too!).

    <title>A Gentle Programming Primer</title>
    <para>
      Using GnomeVFS in an existing application, or writing a new application
      with it, is actually very simple since GnomeVFS tries to mimic POSIX
      file access syntax and semantics. That means that most "standard unix calls" 
      have a GnomeVFS equivalent that operates in a fairly similar manner. There are
      a few differences to keep in mind. 

      <itemizedlist>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The most obvious is probably that all I/O operations return a <type>GnomeVFSResult</type>
	    indicating the success or failure of the operation. More on this later.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The types may be slightly different (but still parallel), for example rather than using an 
	    <type>int</type> for a file-descriptor, GnomeVFS uses <type>GnomeVFSHandle</type>, a handle
	    to a particular URI.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Most operations come in Handle (think file descriptor) and URI form. The URI form may be
	    more convenient if you do not want to track handles, etc, but just be aware that both are
	    at your disposal and may be used interchangably. For example <function>gnome_vfs_open</function>
	    and <function>gnome_vfs_open_uri</function>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      By way of example, consider the basic read command:
      <programlisting>
	ssize_t read (int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      The GnomeVFS equivalent is very similar, but you will notice slightly different data types. The
      consistent returning of a GnomeVFSResult also necessitated moving the return value of read into
      a pass-back-value pointer <variable>bytes_read</variable>:
      <programlisting>
	GnomeVFSResult gnome_vfs_read (GnomeVFSHandle *handle,
	                               gpointer buffer,
                                       GnomeVFSFileSize bytes,
                                       GnomeVFSFileSize *bytes_read);
      </programlisting>
    </para>
