Fri Sep  4 11:54:05 EDT 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	* imlib-config.in (--libs): Reorder libraries.
	(--libs-gdk): Likewise.

1998-06-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* utils/imlib_config.c (read_imrc): Correctly handle the output of
	sscanf.  This was broken, broken, broken.  The code is still

	configure.in.

	* utils/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Include GTK_CFLAGS, not X_CFLAGS.
	(LDADD): Include GTK_LIBS, not explicit gtk/X libraries.

	* configure.in: Use AM_PATH_GTK to find gtk.  Don't use
	AC_CHECK_LIB.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Conditionally build in gdk_imlib.

1998-02-26  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* general: removed all the old Makefile.in files, since raster has
	now endorsed the automakification.

1998-02-24  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* utils/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Also include $(X_CFLAGS).
	(LDADD): Use `libtool', and also link in all those `gtk+' stuff.
	Should probably autoconf this stuff a bit more.

1998-02-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* utils/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added INCLUDES so that it can find
	the gdk_imlib headers.  I hope this is the right way to do it.

	libraries.
