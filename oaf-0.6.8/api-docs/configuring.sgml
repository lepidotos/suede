<para>
To know the list of available CORBA servers on your local machine, the OAF daemon
searches a number of directories for .oafinfo XML files which contain the description
of the services offered by these servers.
By default, OAF will try to find them in ${prefix}/share/oaf which may be a problem
if users install other applications using OAF in different prefixes.
</para>

<para>
To work around this problem, OAF will parse a number of other directories.
It will parse the directories listed in the OAF_INFO_PATH env variable.
It will parse the prefixes listed in the GNOME_PATH env variable.
If, for example, <emphasis>OAF_INFO_PATH=/opt/gnome/share/oaf:/opt/gnome/oaf/share/oaf</emphasis>,
OAF will parse <emphasis>/opt/gnome/share/oaf</emphasis> and <emphasis>/opt/gnome/oaf/share/oaf</emphasis>
If <emphasis>GNOME_PATH=/opt/gnome:/opt/gnome/oaf</emphasis>, OAF will parse
<emphasis>/opt/gnome/share/oaf</emphasis> and <emphasis>/opt/gnome/oaf/share/oaf</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
The above env variables are kept for compatibility purposes with older versions of 
OAF and for GNOME integration. OAF has a much nicer configuration file which allows 
you to control which directories are parsed by OAF. This XML configuration file
is located in ${prefix}/etc/oaf/oaf-config.xml. An empty oaf-config.xml and 
a sample oaf-config.xml.sample file should be installed on your system.
</para>

<para>
It is recommended to use the <emphasis>oaf-sysconf</emphasis> command-line configuration 
tool to edit this file. However, here is an example of its format.
</para>

<programlisting>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>

&lt;oafconfig>

&lt;searchpath>
&lt;item>/opt/gnome/share/oaf&lt;/item>
&lt;item>/usr/local/gnome/share/oaf&lt;/item>
&lt;item>/usr/local/share/oaf&lt;/item>
&lt;item>/opt/gnome/oaf/share/oaf&lt;/item>
&lt;/searchpath>

&lt;searchpath>
&lt;item>/opt/gnome/oaf/share/oaf&lt;/item>
&lt;/searchpath>

&lt;/oafconfig>
</programlisting>

<para>There can be any number of &lt;item> tags in a &lt;searchpath> tag and any number of 
&lt;searchpath tags in the &lt;oafconfig> tag.</para>
