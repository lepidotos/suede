(defmacro do (vars test . body)
  "do VARS (TEST EXPR...) BODY...

`do' is an iteration construct; VARS specifies a set of variable
bindings to be created, how they are initialized and how they are
updated on each iteration. TEST specifies the termination condition of
the loop, any EXPR... forms are evaluated immediately prior to exiting
the `do' construct. The BODY... forms specify the side effecting body
of the loop.

VARS is a list of variable clauses, each of which has the structure
`(VARIABLE INIT STEP)' where VARIABLE is the name of a variable, INIT
defines the initial value of its binding, and STEP defines how the next
value of the binding is computed. An alternative form is `(VARIABLE
INIT)', in this case the value of the binding does not change across
loop iterations.

Each iteration begins by evaluating TEST, if the result is false, then
the BODY... expressions are evaluated, and the variables bound to new
locations initialized to the results of evaluating the associated STEP
forms.

If the result of evaluating TEST is true then the EXPR... forms are
evaluated, and the `do' construct returns the value of the last EXPR
form evaluated.
