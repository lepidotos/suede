  ;; Commentary:

  ;; This module provides an extremely simple message-passing object
  ;; implementation, with support for single inheritance. The `object'
  ;; form expands to a lambda expression, hence it captures local
  ;; bindings for the method implementations.

  ;; Syntax is:

  ;;	(object BASE-OBJECT METHOD...)

  ;; each METHOD is either ((METHOD-NAME . PARAM-LIST) BODY...), or
  ;; (METHOD-NAME FUNCTION).

  ;; PARAM-LIST currently isn't the full lambda spec, just a list of
  ;; symbols. The list can be dotted to a symbol to make a #!rest
  ;; parameter. All parameters are optional (i.e. default to nil)

  ;; Any unknown methods are passed off to BASE-OBJECT, or if that is
  ;; nil, an `unknown-method' error is signalled.

  ;; Each object has the variable `self' bound to the closure
  ;; representing itself. (In superclasses, `self' points to the
  ;; subclass originally called into)

  ;; Example:

  ;; (define obj (object nil
  ;;		   ((foo a b) (+ a b))
  ;;		   (bar -)))

  ;; (obj 'foo 2 1) => 3
  ;; (obj 'bar 2 1) => 1
  ;; (obj 'baz 2 1) error--> unknown method: baz
