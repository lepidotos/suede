;; Commentary:

;; Structures provide the most efficient means of maintaining mappings
;; from symbols to values (tables using eq hashing would be comparable,
;; but less efficient since they're more general).

;; However, I don't want to expose the first-class structure interface
;; to general code, hence these wrappers for making anonymous
;; structures
