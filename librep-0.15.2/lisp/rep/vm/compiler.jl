#| Notes:

Modules
=======

The compiler groks the rep module language, notably it will correctly
resolve (and perhaps inline) references to features of the rep
language, but only if the module header had `(open rep)' and the
feature hasn't been shadowed by a second module.

The compiler has also been written to enable other language dialects to
be compiled, for example `(open scheme)' could mark code as being
scheme. Several properties are set on the name of the module to handle
this:

	compiler-handler-property
	compiler-transform-property
	compiler-foldablep
	compiler-pass-1
	compiler-pass-2

see the compiler-rep module for example usage.

Instruction Encoding
====================

Instructions which get an argument (with opcodes of zero up to
`op-last-with-args') encode the type of argument in the low 3 bits of
their opcode (this is why these instructions take up 8 opcodes). A
value of 0 to 5 (inclusive) is the literal argument, value of 6 means
the next byte holds the argument, or a value of 7 says that the next
two bytes are used to encode the argument (in big- endian form, i.e.
first extra byte has the high 8 bits)

All instructions greater than the `op-last-before-jmps' are branches,
currently only absolute destinations are supported, all branch
instructions encode their destination in the following two bytes (also
in big-endian form).

Any opcode between `op-last-with-args' and `op-last-before-jmps' is a
straightforward single-byte instruction.

The machine simulated by lispmach.c is a simple stack-machine, each
call to the byte-code interpreter gets its own stack; the size of stack
needed is calculated by the compiler.

If you hadn't already noticed I based this on the Emacs version 18
byte-compiler.

Constants
=========

`defconst' forms have to be used with some care. The compiler assumes
that the value of the constant is always the same, whenever it is
evaluated. It may even be evaluated more than once.

In general, any symbols declared as constants (by defconst) have their
values set in stone. These values are hard-coded into the compiled
byte-code.

Also, the value of a constant-symbol is *not* likely to be eq to
itself!

Use constants as you would use macros in C, i.e. to define values which
have to be the same throughout a module. For example, this compiler
uses defconst forms to declare the instruction opcodes.

If you have doubts about whether or not to use constants -- don't; it
may lead to subtle bugs.

Inline Functions
================

The defsubst macro allows functions to be defined which will be open-
coded into any callers at compile-time. Of course, this can have a
similar effect to using a macro, with some differences:

	* Macros can be more efficient, since the formal parameters
	  are only bound at compile time. But, this means that the
	  arguments may be evaluated more than once, unlike a defsubst
	  where applied forms will only ever be evaluated once, when
	  they are bound to a formal parameter

	* Macros are more complex to write; though the backquote mechanism
	  can help a lot with this

	* defsubst's are more efficient in uncompiled code, but this
	  shouldn't really be a consideration, unless code is being
	  generated on the fly

Warnings
========

Currently warnings are generated for the following situations:

	* Functions or special variables are multiply defined
	* Undefined variables are referenced or set ("undefined" means
	  not defined by defvar, not currently (lexically) bound, and
	  not boundp at compile-time)
	* Undefined functions are referenced, that is, not defun'd and
	  not fboundp at compile-time
	* Functions are called with an incorrect number of arguments,
	  either too few required parameters, or too many supplied
	  to a function without a #!rest keyword
	* Unreachable code in conditional statements
	* Possibly some other things...

TODO
====

Obviously, more optimisation of output code. This isdone in two stages,
(1) source code transformations, (2) optimisation of intermediate form
(basically bytecode, but as a list of operations and symbolic labels,
i.e. the basic blocks)

Both (1) and (2) are already being done, but there's probably scope for
being more aggressive, especially at the source code (parse tree)
level.

Optimisation would be a lot more profitable if variables were lexically
scoped, perhaps I should switch to lexical scoping. It shouldn't break
anything much, since the compiler will give warnings if any funky
dynamic-scope tricks are used without the symbols being defvar'd (and
therefore declared special/dynamic)

The constant folding code is a bit simplistic. For example the form (+
1 2 3) would be folded to 6, but (+ 1 2 x) *isn't* folded to (+ 3 x) as
we would like. This is due to the view of folded functions as
``side-effect-free constant black boxes''.
