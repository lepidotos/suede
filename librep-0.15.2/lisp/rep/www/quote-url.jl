;; Background:

;; Sen Nagata posted code to do the escaping part of this to the rep
;; mailing list (<20000424174557J.1000@eccosys.com>). I've rewritten it
;; to use regexps, and added the decoder.

(define-structure rep.www.quote-url

    (export quote-url
	    unquote-url)

    (open rep
	  rep.regexp
	  rep.test.framework)

  (defconst url-meta-re "[^a-zA-Z0-9$_.!~*'(),-]"
    "A regexp matching a single character that is reserved in the URL spec.
This is taken from draft-fielding-url-syntax-02.txt -- check your local
internet drafts directory for a copy.")
       
  (define (quote-url string)
    "Escape URL meta-characters in STRING."
    (string-replace url-meta-re
		    (lambda (s)
		      (string-upcase
		       (format nil "%%%02x" (aref s (match-start)))))
		    string))

  (define (unquote-url string)
    "Unescape URL meta-characters in STRING."
    (string-replace "%([0-9A-Fa-f][0-9A-Fa-f])"
		    (lambda ()
		      (string->number (expand-last-match "\\1") 16))
