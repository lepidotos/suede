This is a very quick hack to the initial GTK theme support provided recently by Red Hat's Rasterman to add a theme that closely mimics the "Java Look-and-Feel" (also known as "Metal").

This is very, very early code and is not polished at all, and is not complete, but a number of controls draw nicely and the color scheme is more-or-less correct so it demos well.

I can't offer any formal support for this at this point - let me know if you are interested and it may encourage me to devote more time to it.
