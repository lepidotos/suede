gshell - a generic bonobo container
===================================

The idea is to make gshell a generic container which provides an emacs like
framework for bonobo components. Since bonobo components support multiple
views it's easy to implement the emacs Buffer/Frame concept. It is also a good
framework to test new components/features.
