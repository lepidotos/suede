How to Upgrade Applications Created With Glade & GTK 1.0 to work with GTK 1.1
=============================================================================

There were quite a few changes between GTK 1.0 and 1.1, and so source code
written for GTK 1.0 will not work with GTK 1.1.

First, you need to recompile Glade with GTK 1.1.
Then you can load your XML file into Glade and regenerate the source code.

However, there are a couple of differences in the XML files used with GTK 1.0
and GTK 1.1, due to changes in a few GTK widgets.

I think the main problem is GtkCList - in GTK 1.0 it handles scrolling itself.
In GTK 1.1 you have to put it inside a GtkScrolledWindow.
You can edit the XML yourself and place a scrolled window around the CList,
e.g.

    <widget>
      <class>GtkScrolledWindow</class>

      <widget>
        <class>GtkCList</class>
        ...

      </widget>
    </widget>

You may also need to move any <child> options from the clist up to the
scrolled window.


If you used the GtkText widget you may also want to place that in a scrolled
window as well. You'll also probably want to set the horizontal scrollbar
policy to GTK_POLICY_NEVER so the horizontal scrollbar is never shown, since
GtkText doesn't support horizontal scrolling.



Let me know of any other changes needed, and I'll add them here.
