This is a simple example application built with Glade.

NOTE: You need gettext 0.10.35 installed to build it.

It is a text editor, with standard commands to open and save files,
cut/copy/paste text, and set the font.

The signal handler code in src/callbacks.c has been commented to make it
easy to understand how a Glade application is put together.

It is not built normally as part of Glade. To build it, you must cd into the
editor directory, remove the 'NO-AUTO-GEN' file, then run:

./autogen.sh
make

Then run src/glade-editor.
