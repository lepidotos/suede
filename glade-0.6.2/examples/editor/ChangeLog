	* src/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): changed name to glade-editor rather
	than glade_editor, which was output due to a bug in Glade.

	* src/callbacks.[hc]: renamed on_Quit_activate and on_Delete_activate
	to on_Exit_activate and on_Clear_activate to match menus. 'Exit' and
	'Clear' are the standard Gnome menu items.

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): used $(srcdir) when installing
	pixmaps.

	* editor.glade: updated menubar to use underlined accelerator keys.
	Added handlebox around menubar and toolbar, and set toolbar button
	relief to None. (The handlebox doesn't seem to work too well - you
	need to set the border width to 2 for the shadow to display properly.)
	Set default window size of the main window to 600x450, reset the width
	and height, and turned Shrink off.
