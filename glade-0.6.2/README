	 (a user interface builder for the GTK+ toolkit and GNOME)

General Information
===================

Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces
for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. It also contains
built-in support for generating the C source code needed to recreate the
interfaces.

The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in the well-known XML format,
enabling easy integration with external tools. Several tools are already
available which can turn the XML files into source code in other languages
such as C++, Perl and Python. Other tools such as libglade can load the XML
files and create the interfaces at runtime (see the Languages Supported section
below).

Glade is primarily aimed at Linux and other Unix variants, though it can be
run on Win32 platforms (without the GNOME support). A port is included in the
Ada95 package (see the link below).


Glade Documentation
===================

A User Guide and FAQ are available from the 'Help' menu in Glade.
The User Guide is not finished yet.

See the 'TODO' file for current status & planned future developments.


License
=======

Glade is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), as described
in the COPYING file.

Note that you are free to use whatever license you like for the source code
generated by Glade. (We do not consider the code generated by Glade to be
'a work based on the Program' as described at the start of the GPL.)


Requirements
============

 o GTK+ 1.2.0 or above - http://www.gtk.org

 o gnome-libs >= 1.0.50 if you want GNOME support. If you have an older version
   of gnome-libs installed and don't want to upgrade, use
   './configure --disable-gnome' to build Glade without GNOME support.

 o Automake 1.4 - ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/automake
                  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake
		  ftp://rawhide.redhat.com/pub/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/
			(for i386 RPMs)
   This is needed to build the C source code generated by Glade.

 o Autoconf 2.13 - ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/autoconf
                   http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf
		   ftp://rawhide.redhat.com/pub/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/
			(for i386 RPMs)
   This is needed to build the C source code generated by Glade.

 o Gettext 0.10.35 - ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gettext-0.10.35.tar.gz
   This is needed if you want to build applications with support for gettext.
   (Gettext provides support for translating the strings in your application
    into other languages such as French, German, Spanish etc.)

 o Scrollkeeper 0.1.4 - http://scrollkeeper.sourceforge.net
   This is a fairly new package for maintaining DocBook documentation on a
   system.


Languages Supported
===================

 o C - Glade outputs C code itself.
       The libglade library is also available. It creates the user interface
       dynamically by loading the XML files generated by Glade.
       See http://www.daa.com.au/~james/gnome/.

 o C++ (for the Gtk-- bindings) - http://home.wtal.de/petig/

 o Ada - support is included in the Ada GTK+ bindings: http://ada.eu.org/gtkada

 o Python support is included in the PyGTK bindings. See http://www.gtk.org
   A python source code generator is also being developed.
   See http://glc.sourceforge.net

 o Perl - http://freespace.virgin.net/dermot.musgrove/computers/perl/
       or http://www.glade.perl.connectfree.co.uk/index.html
       or on CPAN under the Glade module,
	 e.g. ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/CPAN/modules/by-module/Glade/

 o Eiffel - http://www.lfix.co.uk/eiflib/index.html#eglade


The Glade web site may contain more up-to-date links.

Please note that these packages are maintained independantly of Glade, and
so any bug reports should be sent to the appropriate package maintainer.


Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'


Mailing Lists
=============

There are three mailing lists related to Glade:

  glade-announce@ximian.com - A moderated list for announcements of new
				 versions of Glade and other closely-related
				 tools, such as libglade and the various code
				 generators.

  glade-users@ximian.com    - For discussions about using Glade to build
				 applications.

  glade-devel@ximian.com    - For discussions about the development of
				 Glade itself.

To subscribe, unsubscribe, or view the archives of the lists go to the
mailman web pages at:

  http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/glade-announce
  http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/glade-users
  http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/glade-devel


Alternatively you can use email to perform commands by mailing:

  glade-announce-request@ximian.com
  glade-users-request@ximian.com
  glade-devel-request@ximian.com

with commands such as 'subscribe' and 'help' in the subject line or
the message body.



How to report bugs
==================

To report a bug in Glade itself, send mail to damon@ximian.com
(Please don't send bug reports for the external code generators here.
They should be sent to the appropriate package maintainer.)

In the mail include:

* The version of Glade.

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What version of GTK+.
   - If you are using the GNOME version of Glade, and if so which version
     of GNOME you are using.
   - What operating system and version.

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

* If you can, send a stack trace. To do that, start gdb with 'gdb glade',
  start glade with 'r', do whatever causes the crash, and then type 'bt' in
  the debugger to print a stack trace.


Submitting Patches
==================

Please use diff -ru to create the patch, and send it as a gzipped file
attachment. If it entails major changes to Glade, please discuss it on
the glade-devel list first.
