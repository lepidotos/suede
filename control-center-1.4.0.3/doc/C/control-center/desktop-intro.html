	<P

	  The Theme Selector capplet  allows

	</P

	<P

	  feel of such elements of graphical user interface as buttons,
	  menus, scrollbars etc. of all Gnome applications (more
	  generally, of all applications using the GIMP Toolkit (GTK),
	  hence the name). 
	</P

	<P
>	  To change your GTK theme select a theme from the
	  <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Available Themes</B
></TT
> list on the left side
	  of the main workspace. If you have <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Auto
	  Preview</B

	  the theme looks like in the preview window below. Note that
	  the preview window is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"live"</SPAN
>: you can click on
	  a button, enter text in sample text entry box, etc. If you
	  like the theme press the <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Try</B
> button
	  on the bottom of the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnome Control
	  Center</TT
> to install it.
	</P
>
	<P
>	  There are a few GTK themes that come loaded with Gnome when
	  you install it.  If you would like more themes you can check
	  resources on the Internet such as the <A
HREF="http://gtk.themes.org"
TARGET="_top"
>GTK Themes
	  site</A
>.  Once you have found and downloaded a theme
	  you like, press the <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Install new theme</B
>
	  button. This will launch a file browser that allows you to
	  find the theme you have just downloaded. The theme files
	  should be in a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tar.gz</TT
> or
	  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.tgz</TT
> format (otherwise known as a
	  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"tarball"</SPAN
>).  Once you have found the file press
	  the <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>OK</B
> and Gnome will install the
	  theme in the appropriate directory
	  (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.themes</TT
>) automatically. Now you can
	  look in the <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B

	  the theme you have installed.
