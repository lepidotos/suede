	* gnome-control-center-guide.sgml: added all of the stuff from the
	UG to kick start this. jrb made a new release last week with
	interface changes - we need to adjust the current docs to that so
	that gnomecc can be released with the 1.2 release - no major
	additions should be made besides the panel stuff - contact
	dcm@redhat.com if you disagree!
