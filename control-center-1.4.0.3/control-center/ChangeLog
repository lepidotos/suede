	enough not to truncate Debian name.

2001-02-08  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>
	* control-center/splash.c: Use uname_struct.release rather than
	uname_struct.version, since the latter more accurately indicates the
	kernel version.

2000-11-15  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* Makefile.am (cappletConf.sh): add a sed command to replace
	@VERSION@ with the correct version so 'gnome-config --modversion
	capplet' returns the correct value.  Fixes bug #30206.

	(create_splash_screen): Use a fontset rather than a font for the text

	* callbacks.c (exit_dialog_ok_callback): Change return value:
	return FALSE iff actually exiting

2000-10-07  Bradford Hovinen  <hovinen@helixcode.com>

2000-09-03  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* tree.h: Add missing `void' in the prototype for
	`generate_tree()'.

	* tree.c (free_directory_list): New helper function.
	(get_directory_list): New helper function.
	(add_directories_from_GNOME_PATH): New helper function.
	(read_all_directories): New helper function.
	(generate_tree): Use these new functions to activate the capplets
	from the global directory, the user directory, as well as the
	directories defined by `GNOME_PATH'.  Also, update the error
	message for the case in which the Control Center doesn't find any
	capplets.  And add the `void' type.

	`.directory' file.  Instead, build a `GnomeDesktopEntry' from the
	directory name and put it in the tree.
	(merge_nodes): If one of the nodes has a NULL `name' member while
	the other one has a non-NULL one, set the name of the result node
	to the non-NULL value.  When freeing an entry, set it to NULL.

	* tree.c (generate_tree_helper): remove potential segfault if you
	don't have access to the .desktop file.

2000-06-19  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* splash.c (get_linux_info): Added conectiva-linux checking code.
	I don't think this approach will scale in the long run,
	unfortunately, but it will do for now.  I think most companies
	should patch their SRPMS.

2000-05-22  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

2000-03-28  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* capplet-manager.c: Big changes.  Now we no longer use
	gtknotebook, and the world is better for it.  Added
	gtk-multiview.[ch] to handle switching better w/o the bevel.
	Also, removed the help button and made it a menu.  The docs guys
	are going to kill me, but I'll try to help them fix it all
	tomorrow.

1999-04-14  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	people could beat on it, i'd appreciate it.

1999-02-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* tree.c (selected_row_callback): Make absolutely sure we do not
	keep any sort of grabs that might hang the desktop before
	launching the capplet (as we might block inside of ORBit if the
	client dies).

1999-02-24  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* tree.c (generate_tree_helper): Comment out the icon code until
	we actually have enough icons to make it worthwhile.

1999-02-24  bertrand <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@inria.fr>

	* capplet-widget-libs.c (capplet_widget_corba_init): Now it's
	started using gnorba.  A good thing.

	* capplet-widget.c (get_widget_by_id): added a page_shown;
	page_hidden call to let capplets with dialogs show/hide when
	needed. 

	* capplet-manager.c (launch_capplet): okay...
	it's a little ugly, but it now will close pages that haven't been
	changed.
