	in .gtkrc. but GTK+ already has 'fontset' in /etc/gtk/gtkrc*, and GTK+ 
	gives priority to 'fontset' over 'font'. so that GTK+ has ignored 
	user-font in .gtkrc. (Akira TAGOH) Fixes bug #66556

	* configure.in: Correct a typo.

2001-03-28  Dan Mueth  <dan@eazel.com>

	Fixing every capplet in control-center, since none of them
	actually used the ghelp URL handler as they should - instead
	they were pulling up help as a normal URL ie. in Netscape.
	Now they should load in the ghelp handler.
	It is cute how almost every one has a different help callback 
	function name, although the contents are pretty much identical.

2001-02-22  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	reviewed by: Jacob Berkman <jacob@ximian.com>
	
	Added a new interface so that capplets that do direct manipulation
	of parameters can work in the control center environment.  Without
	this interface, the control-center assumes that changes made
	are lost when the control-center is closed.  The control center
	also enables the Try and Revert button which do not apply
	to an immediate change capplet that has no rollback state.
	
	* idl/control-center.idl:
	Add new changes_are_imediate interface

	* control-center/capplet-widget-libs.c: (do_quit),
	(capplet_corba_gtk_main_quit),

	* */*/*.desktop, */*/*.directory: Added Greek
	translations.

2001-1-16  Mike Engber  <engber@eazel.com> 

	* capplets/background-properties/render-background.c: We were
	leaking x-server memory. The test before the call to XKillClient,
	nitems == 4, always failed. It should have been nitems == 1. Also,
	we now free the ptr returned by XGetWindowProperty whenever it's
	not NULL - previously we were never freeing it because of the
	aforementioned problem, but in general, it needs to always be
	freed. Also, we now examine the return value from XGetWindowProperty
	before using its results.

Wed Jan 03 04:15:04 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* capplets/background-properties/render-background.c: Do what the
	  comment says and create a new display connection.  Otherwise all
	  resources get leaked to the root, and not just the root pixmap
	  as intended.  Imlib pixmap cache should make leaking all resources
	  even a more memorable experience.

2000-11-23  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz> 

	* */*/*.desktop, */*/*.directory: Remove trailing dot in english
	strings containing menu name or tooltip (discussed in gnome-i18n

 	capplets exit properly.

        /* This gross hack is here because just doing gtk_main_quit()
           won't exit a modal dialog that has popped up in a capplet,
           but at the same time just doing exit() won't let some
           capplets (e.g. wm-properties) do their preference saving in
           the post-gtk_main() part of main() -ECL */

	When setting the dpms settings for the X server, use
	gnome_config_get_int to retrieve the user setting rather than
	gnome_config_get_string.  Before, it was adding together two
	pointers, multiplying the value by 60 and casting it as an int :)

	 - Doesn't call gdk_property_get() with the arguments in 
	   the wrong order.

	 - Doesn't leak anything else. (I.e., use a separate
	   connection, instead of calling XSetCloseDownMode
	   on GDK_DISPLAY())
	 - Doesn't make a messy, unsucessful attempt at committing suicide
	 - Handles tiled pixmaps properly.

1998-07-13  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (mico_prefix): Stop searching as soon as a
	`mico-ld' is found.  From Michael Lausch <mla@gams.co.at>.

1998-07-08  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@fresnel.labs.redhat.com>

Fri Jun 12 22:56:58 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: added gmenu/Makefile

1998-06-11  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu directory: Checked in a gmenu, the GNOME menu editor,
	still needs a Makefile.am file though.

Wed Jun 10 11:34:52 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* configure.in: Make panel link micocoss library as well

Wed Jun 10 11:34:52 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* configure.in acconfig.h: Check for installed MICO
	  version, and the libs it requires by using mico-ld 
	  and mico-setup.sh.

	  Add a HAVE_MICO_ORB_RUN macro to signal that we need
	  to call orb->run(), as we do for mico-2.0.6 and later

Tue Jun  9 23:37:43 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* .cvsignore updates.


1998-06-09  Jim Pick  <jim@jimpick.com>

	with gtk1.1

1998-06-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* core-docs/Makefile.am: fixed it so that "make dist" will
	generate a reasonable distribution.  Many files were not listed in
	the EXTRAS, but I think they now are.

1998-05-30  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (FALSE): Automake conditional that always fails.
	This is used in some subdir Makefile.am tricks.

1998-05-26  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	net/ppp_defs.h does not exist on solaris.

	* configure.in: added GNOME_FILEUTILS_CHECKS

	* acconfig.h (AFS, MOUNTED_FREAD, MOUNTED_FREAD_FSTYP,
	MOUNTED_GETFSSTAT, MOUNTED_GETMNT, MOUNTED_GETMNTENT1,
	MOUNTED_GETMNTENT2, MOUNTED_GETMNTINFO, MOUNTED_LISTMNTENT,
	MOUNTED_VMOUNT, STAT_STATFS3_OSF1, STAT_READ_FILSYS,
	STAT_STATFS2_BSIZE, STAT_STATFS2_FSIZE, STAT_STATFS2_FS_DATA,
	STAT_STATFS4, STAT_STATVFS, STATFS_TRUNCATES_BLOCK_COUNTS):
	New macros.

	* configure.in: added applets/bussign/Makefile to the list of
 	Makefiles.

1998-05-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* core-docs/gnome-intro.sgml: added a bit more to the panel;
	that's it for the Red Hat 5.1 release, I guess.

	* core-docs/Makefile.am (install-data-local): fixed little bug in
	installing help files.

	* core-docs/gnome-intro.sgml: completed the GNOME intro; there are
	many omissions, but it seems OK.  Now I have to proofread it a bit
	and add a mention of panel applets.  I also added all the
	generated HTML files for people who do not have the docbook tools
	installed (this sucks).

	* core-docs/Makefile.am: put core-docs under automake with some
	quickly hacked-up rules for the RH-5.1 release.  I will clean it
	up later; this seems to work and install gnome-intro in a way such
	that the help browser picks it up.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added core-docs

Sun May  3 22:43:59 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	overall gnome-intro manual.

Mon Apr 27 20:42:24 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	  the xpm files for _thoose_ icons wern't there.

Sun Apr 26 10:55:18 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>
	
	* Its too early in the morning!

Sun Apr 26 10:55:18 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* configure.in: changed the AC_PROG_LEX -> AM_PROG_LEX
	  though I couldn't find any lex files that this is needed
	  for. IIRC automake 1.2 supports this macro also.

        * applets/*/.cvsignore: updated to ignore generated files.

	  interface, but didn't do anything with it yet.

	* panel.c,clock.c: fixed some FIXME's and added some 
	  sanity checks

	checks that happen in macros/gnome-x-checks.m4.

Thu Feb 26 12:37:07 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

1998-02-25  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>
