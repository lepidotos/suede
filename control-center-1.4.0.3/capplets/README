This directory holds the capplets for the control-center.  The
desktop-links directory holds the .directory files without associated
capplets.  Every capplet is intended to have it's own .desktop file
specifying what capplet is supposed to be run.  The overall layout for
the control-center tree is tentatively planned to be.

+Workspace
	Screensaver Properties

	Virtual Desktops (*)
	Multiple Desktops (*)

Items marked with + are just directories.
Items marked with (*) are window manager specific.

How to handle the window manager specific stuff?
The easiest way to do this is to add a tag to the .desktop entries,
(or use the try-exec field) that holds the name of a little test
program.  This program, when run, would return 0 if a particular
window manager is running, and 1 if it isn't.  

For example, we might have a fvwm-test in the Fvwm.background.desktop
entry.  If fvwm is running, fvwm-test will return TRUE, and the
Fvwm.background capplet will appear in the control-center.  Every
window manager should provide it's own set of capplets.  I will write
a background-properties-capplet widget that will act like a template for the
other window-managers.  Maybe a Virtual Desktop one too.

Anyway, I'm not 100% sure about the tree, so if anyone has any better
suggestions/organizational setups, please let me know...
