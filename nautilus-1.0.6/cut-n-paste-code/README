README for nautilus/cut-n-paste-code

The code in this directory hierarchy was cut-n-pasted from 
somewhere else.

In the soon to come, Star Trek future, this code will be available
as part of standard libraries.

For example, the code in widgets/e-paned will be available as part
of Gtk+ 1.4.

Until that happens, DON'T HACK the code, unless you are updating 
from the original cut-n-paste source.  For example, 
evolution/widgets/e-paned.

Instead of hacking the code in cut-n-paste-code, create subclasses 
and put them in libnautilus-extensions.

If you have any specific questions, comments or complaints about this
setup, send mail to the nautilus mailing list at:

nautilus-list@lists.eazel.com
