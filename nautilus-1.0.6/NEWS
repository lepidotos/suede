=== Version 1.0.6

Nautilus 1.0.6 contains a small number of fixes to bugs introduced in
1.0.5 and a few small new features. Here's a list of changes since 1.0.5:

* Add feature where "can't write" emblems don't appear in directories
  that are complete "can't write" (Alex)
* Add scrollkeeper indexing capabilities (Louise Miller)
* Fix bug where notifications didn't take effect (Darin)
* Fix hysteresis so it doesn't affect changes after the icon view has
  loaded (Darin)
* Add libiconv include paths so people who use platforms without iconv
  in the libc can build (Alex)
* Localize desktop link names properly (Benedikt Roth)
* Some updated translations

=== Version 1.0.5

Nautilus 1.0.5 contains more speedups, and some features and bug
fixes.

Many of the changes for this release were done by hackers at Red Hat
(Jonathan Blandford, Havoc Pennington, Alex Larsson, Owen Taylor) for
their Nautilus release, and rolled into the main Nautilus sources,
mostly by Alex. Thanks also to Alan Cox for doing a profile of system
calls Nautilus was making and driving some simple but effective
speedups.

As a practical matter, many of the changes here that were inspired by
changes that others made or patches they submitted may still be marked
"(Darin)" since I did the actual check-i. Similarly, changes done by
others may be marked "(Alex)" since he did the rolling in even though
others did the original code (sometimes I tried to guess).

Here's a partial list of changes since Nautilus 1.0.4:

- speed-related changes

* Turn off trash emblem for speed (Darin)
* Cache more icons in the icon cache (Darin)
* Reduce number of suffixes to search for when locating icons (Darin)
* Remove Eazel logo graphics so we have one less place to search (Darin)
* Change internals of NautilusDirectory to avoid n^2 behavior on large
  directory loads (Maciej)
* Add hash table for mapping icon data to icons in the icon container
  to avoid n^2 behavior in large directories (Maciej)
* Cache user information so we don't do so many getpwuid calls (Alex)
* Add a help icon that fires up Nautilus (Alex)
* Load images with a 64K buffer in the image view (Darin)

  optional FAM support (Alex)

- significant bug fixes

* Fix problem that made Notes and History panels crash on startup if you
  had already run Nautilus prviously on the same machine (Darin)
* Remove hard-coded colors from the default themes, and let automatic
  color selection kick in (Alex)
* Don't monitor files on read-only volumes so CD-ROMs can be unmounted
  without any trouble (Alex)
* Get rid of the flash on Nautilus startup (Jonathan, Alex)
* Stop trying to read GMC position metadata (Alex)

  which take ints to make things more portable (Darin)
* Other fixes for compiling on Solaris (Darin)

=== Version 1.0.4

Nautilus 1.0.4 contains some speedups, largely due to the work done by
Yoann Vandoorselaere to investigate what makes it slow. There's still
plenty of room for more work there.

There are also lots of other minor improvements since Nautilus 1.0.3.

A partial list of changes since Nautilus 1.0.3:

	Fixes to bugs and other changes to speed up Nautilus's
	display of new directories (Yoann, Darin, Maciej)

	FreeBSD compile fixes (Darin, Gene)

	Fixes to compile with C compilers that don't allow empty
	structures (Darin)

	Fix to the MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME setting code to make the Mozilla
	component work in more configurations. (peter@ximian.com, Darin)

	Make thumbnails always go in the home directory if "Make
	Folder Appearance Details Public" is set to Never (John,
	Michael Rothwell)

	Fixed a few small i18n problems. (Darin)

	Use Bonobo to handle additional key bindings, instead of using
	our own hack code. (Darin)

	Make default Web Search use google instead of the defunct
	Eazel search page. (Darin)

	Fix bug reading track info from MP3 files. (Jon K Hellan)

	Make News panel flash less. (Andy)

	Fixed bug in throbber destruction process (Darin, Owen)

	Added prelighting and tracking to the throbber (Anders, Darin)

	Use Control keys rather than Alt keys to move around in the
	file manager windows because Sawfish changed to use Alt again
	(John Harper)

	Fix MIME bug that might lead to the wrong default component
	getting used. This could have been what caused some people to
	get the text view instead of the web page view. (Darin)

	Fix problems typing non-ASCII characters on some systems
	(Johan Dahlin, Darin)

	Install IDL files for non-C component programmers (Johan
	Dahlin, Darin, Ramiro)

	Support trash on XFS volumes (Caleb J. Land, Darin)

	Updated lots of icons, including most of the ones in the
	classic GNOME theme (Ben FrantzDale, Seth Nickell)

	Updated quick reference, release notes, and user manual in
	help. (Dan Mueth)

	Obfuscate passwords in URIs in thumbnail directories.
	(Miguel Rodríguez Pérez)

	Dumb down run-nautilus so it doesn't start Nautilus slowly.
	It is really obsolete (Darin).

	Get rid of Eazel home page and Eazel services in first-time
	druid (Havoc)

	Make standard view components hang around for 30 seconds,
	making it faster to use the same viewer repeatedly (Zbigniew
	Chyla).

	Other bug fixes (Juan Pablo Mendoza, limval@yahoo.com,
	Frederic Devernay, Darin, Benedikt Roth, Andy)

We won't be porting Nautilus to GNOME 2 until the library freeze date
(at the request of the library developers, Michael Meeks mainly) so
this is still a GNOME 1 source tree for now.
