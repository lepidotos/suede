This is a DocBook xml->html converter to replace gnome-db2html2 for
GNOME help file rendering in the Nautilus Mozilla component. It uses
libxslt and libxml2 along with Normal Walsh's stylesheets with a GNOME
customization layer to convert docs on the fly. It also has a built-in
sgml->xml converter to remain backwards compatible with existing sgml
docs.
