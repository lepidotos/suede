Nautilus source tree is available from CVS (the latest-cutting edge
version) and in releases (tarballs).

If you plan to hack on Nautilus, please make sure you work from the
CVS version. The CVS version is available on GNOME CVS. The page
http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html details how to get started
with GNOME CVS.

If you want to contribute patches, please send mail to the nautilus
maintainer (Darin Adler <darin@bentspoon.com>) and/or the nautilus mailing
list: <nautilus-list@lists.eazel.com> (subscriptions should be made to
<nautilus-list-request@lists.eazel.com> with "subscribe" as a
subject).

Patches should be made with 'cvs diff -pu >patch' and should conform to
Nautilus coding style as described in docs/style-guide.html Please
read other relevant documents in the docs directory too.

2: Using the leak checker
=========================

The leak checker is built as part of the eazel-tools gnome module.
Build that first before you continue.

Nautilus is set up to use the libleakcheck.so leak checking
library. To use it, run Nautilus with LD_PRELOAD set to the path to
the installed libleakcheck.so library. For example, if you are using a
Bourne-compatible shell, like bash, you can run Nautilus this way to
run with leak checking:

LD_PRELOAD=/gnome/lib/libleakcheck.so /gnome/bin/nautilus
