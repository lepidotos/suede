  <P

   Nautilus documentation which is shipped with Nautilus.

></H2
>   
   <P
>    Nautilus should be set to the "Default" theme. Because the
    Nautilus, Gtk+, and Sawfish themes are not yet integrated, you
    will have to manually set the Gtk+ and Sawfish themes to "Crux" in the
    GNOME Control Center.  You will also need to set the color to
    match that of the default Nautilus theme by selecting
    <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>'Crux' GTK+ Theme</B
></TT
> in the Control Center and
    set the color to 0.37, 0.44, and 0.60 for red, green and blue
    respectively.
   </P

  </DIV

  <DIV
CLASS="SECT2"
><H2
CLASS="SECT2"
><A
NAME="size"
>Screenshot Size</A
></H2
>   
   <P
>    Screenshots should be small enough to fit in the default-sized
    Nautilus main panel which is 646 by 418 pixels.  Note that this
    size includes any callouts which may be present.  You should
    generally allow 7 pixels on the top and left and 11 pixels on the
    bottom and right for the drop shadow, so your original screenshot
    should be no more than 628 by 400.  If you will have callouts, you
    should allow 34 pixels for each side with a callout instead of the
    7 or 11 pixels for the drop shadow. (eg. A screenshot for a
    figure with a callout on the left should be at most 646-11-34=601
    pixels across. For one with a callout on the bottom, is should be
    at most 418-7-34=377 high.)
   </P
>
   <P
>    When specifying the geometry of a Nautilus window, remember the
    geometry does not include the border decorations.  Using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>    nautilus --geometry 520x335</B
> works nicely.
   </P

  <DIV
CLASS="SECT2"
><H2
CLASS="SECT2"
><A
NAME="focus"
>Window Focus</A
></H2
>   
   <P
>    You should always make sure that the window you are taking a
    screenshot of has "focus", ie. if you were to type the text you
    type would be directed to this window.  Generally the window
    decorations appear differently when the window has focus - it
    often has more color or brighter color.  Typically a window is
    given focus by clicking on the window border, but this will vary
    depending upon your window manager configuration.

   <P
>    Screenshots should not include any trademarked logos, such as
    Eazel's logo, Red Hat's logo, or any others.  It may contain the
    GNOME logo. If your screenshot has a logo, please erase the logo
    in the GIMP.

   <P

    you should use colors with low saturation values for callouts or
    any other drawings you make on your image.

>Callouts</DT

        portions of the screenshot.

><DT
>Circled Object Callouts</DT
><DD
>       <P
>        For small items in a screenshot, such as buttons or icons, a
        modified callout is used which circles the item.

        to represent the action of a drag-and-drop action.
