  <sect1 id="introdesktop">
   <title>The Nautilus Desktop</title>

   <para>
    The desktop is the background area of your screen. If Nautilus was
    pre-installed on your GNOME system, Nautilus draws the
    desktop. The desktop on your computer can look like your physical
    desktop - it can be full of folders, icons, and works in progress,
    or it can be clear. Nautilus lets you organize it the way
    you want.
   </para>

    If Nautilus doesn't already draw the desktop on your system, do
    this:

    Initially, the desktop contains three items: a house icon that
    represents your home location, an Eazel Services icon that takes
    you to Eazel's Web site, and a Trash icon.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can create folders on the desktop or drag additional files
    and folders from the Nautilus window to the desktop. For instance,
    you can create a folder that contains your current projects and
    keep it on the desktop for easy access. You also mount disks (such
    as floppies or CD-ROMs) on the desktop.
   </para>

    <title>Saving Startup Programs On Logout</title>
    <para>
     Note that whenever you log out of GNOME, the logout dialog
     allows you to select to have GNOME record the actively running
     programs and restart them the next time you start GNOME.  If you
     do this, GNOME will forget the old list of startup programs and
     replace it with the programs which were running when you logged
     out.

    To stop Nautilus from launching automatically, quit Nautilus and
    then follow the instructions above to save your session.

    When you first launch Nautilus, you'll see your home folder in the

   <para>
    Note that depending on your user-level setting, your home folder
    may be the default Nautilus home folder, which contains basic
    information about your computer and pointers to some useful
    applications, or the home folder defined for you in your Linux
    settings (normally /home/<emphasis>your_name</emphasis>).

  <sect1 id="settings">
   <title>Setting Your User Level</title>

   <para>
    When you first lanched Nautilus, you were asked to choose your
    user level: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. The user level
    dictates the amount of detail you see while navigating your files
    and folders:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Beginner: For users who have no previous experience
      with Linux or GNOME.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Intermediate: For users who have had some experience with Linux
      or GNOME but don't want to see every detail of their
      system.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Advanced: For users who like to see every detail of
      their system, including the ugly stuff.
     </para>
    </listitem>

   </itemizedlist>

   <para>
    To change your user level, open the Preferences menu and choose
    the level you want.

   <para>
    One way to see the difference between the levels is to go to your
    home directory and then compare what you see as you select each
    level in turn. Be sure to return to the level with which you're
    comfortable when you're done.

    The preference settings adjust the appearance of Nautilus, the
    behavior of files and folders when you view and click them, the

   <title>What Are MIME Types?</title>

   <para>
    MIME types are a standard way to identify files so that they can
    be easily transmitted over the Internet. MIME stands for
    "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extention." Each type of file is
    assigned a specific MIME type. For instance, the MIME type for
    HTML files is "text/html," and the MIME type for JPEG files is
    "image/jpeg." A file's MIME type tells Internet applications such
    as browsers and email programs what type of file is being
    exchanged, how to encode it for transmission, and how to decode it
    when it arrives at its destination.
   </para>

   <para>
    Unless you've specified that a particular application or viewer
    should open a file, it normally opens automatically in an
    application that's appropriate for the type. For instance, a JPEG
    file normally opens automatically in a graphics application.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can choose which application or viewer opens automatically for
    a particular type of file. You can also set up new applications to
    handle particular types of files.

  <para>
   Nautilus installs various data files on your system which it uses
   to store your preferences and data such as image thumbnails, notes,
   icon positions, and news sources.  If you are an advanced user, you
   may wish to know a little more about these files or to modify them
   by hand in order to reset your configuration to the default.  This
   is especially helpful if you have installed unofficial releases of
   Nautilus in the past which may be incompatible with the latest
   official release.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Nautilus Preferences Files</emphasis>
  </para>

  <para>
   Your global Nautilus preferences are stored in files in the
   .nautilus folder in your home folder.  For example, your bookmarks
   are in your bookmarks.xml file and the list of your news sources
   and whether each one is displayed is stored in your
   news_channels.xml file.  These files are installed when you run
   Nautilus if they are not present.  If you would like to set them
   back to their initial default state, simply quit Nautilus, delete
   the file you would like to reset, and then start Nautilus.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Nautilus Metadata Files</emphasis>
  </para>

  <para>
   For each folder you browse, Nautilus stores metadata such as
   thumbnails of the images in the folder and custom configuration the
   user does to the folder.  This may include custom backgrounds,
   icons, icon positions, and notes.  If you have write permission
   to the folder, the thumbnails are stored in the folder in a hidden
   folder called .thumbnails and any custom configuration information
   is stored in a hidden file called .nautilus-metafile.xml.  If you
   do not have write permission to the folder, this information is
   stored in the .nautilus folder inside your home folder.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Updating Your News</emphasis>
  </para>

  <para>
   New versions of Nautilus often update their default News list.
   However, it will not change your news file if you have one already
   installed.  To remove your current news file so that Nautilus will
   replace it with the default News sidebar configuration, simply quit
   Nautilus, delete the .nautilus/news_channel.xml file, then start
   Nautilus. 
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Updating Your Metadata From Preview Releases</emphasis>
  </para>

  <para>
   Nautilus versions prior to 1.0 used metadata files which do not
   work properly with Nautilus versions 1.0 and later.  To update the
   metadata file in a given directory, use the command
   nautilus-xml-update <emphasis>directory</emphasis>.  For more
   details, see the <ulink type="help"

 <!-- Appendix: Default Emblems -->
 <chapter id="appendix2">
  <title>Default Emblems</title>

  <para>
   Nautilus applies emblems automatically to icons for files that are
   read or write only and to icons that are links (aliases) to other
   files or folders.
  </para>

  <para>
   The default emblems change depending on your theme. The ones shown
   here are for two of the Nautilus themes, but if you have a custom
   theme, your emblems may be different.
  </para>

   can't modify it.

  <para>
   A link icon denotes a file that contains no content of its own but
   links to a file or folder located elsewhere on the
   computer. Clicking this icon opens the linked file or folder. (A
   link is similar to a shortcut in Windows or an alias in the Mac
   OS.)
