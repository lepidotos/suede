      Nearly all image operations are performed by right-clicking
      on the image.  And don't worry, you can undo most mistakes...

    You can get context-sensitive help for most of the GIMP's features by
    pressing the F1 key at any time.  This also works inside the menus.
    </_thetip>

    <_thetip>    
    The GIMP uses layers to let you organize your image.  Think of them
    as a stack of slides or filters, such that looking through them you
    see a composite of their contents.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="beginner">
    <_thetip>
    You can perform many layer operations by right-clicking on the text
    label of a layer in the &quot;Layers, Channels and Paths&quot; dialog.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="beginner">
    <_thetip>
    When you save an image to work on it again later, try using XCF,
    the GIMP's native file format (use the file extension &quot;.xcf&quot;).
    This preserves the layers and every aspect of your work-in-progress.
    Once a project is completed, you can save it as JPEG, PNG, GIF, ...
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="beginner">
    <_thetip>
    The layer named &quot;Background&quot; it special because it lacks 
    transparency. This prevents you from adding a layer mask or moving 
    the layer up in the stack.  You may add transparency to it by 
    right-clicking in the &quot;Layers, Channels and Paths&quot; dialog 
    and selecting &quot;Add Alpha Channel&quot;.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="beginner">
    <_thetip>
    Most plug-ins work on the current layer of the current image.  In
    some cases, you will have to merge all layers (Layers-&gt;Flatten Image)
    if you want the plug-in to work on the whole image.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="beginner">
    <_thetip>
    Not all effects can be applied to all kinds of images.  This is
    indicated by a grayed-out menu-entry.  You may need to change
    the image mode to RGB (Image-&gt;Mode-&gt;RGB), add an alpha-channel
    (Layers-&gt;Add Alpha Channel) or flatten it (Layers-&gt;Flatten Image).

    You can drag and drop many things in the GIMP.  For example, dragging
    a color from the toolbox or from a color palette and dropping it into
    an image will fill the current image or selection with that color.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>
    When using a drawing tool (Paintbrush, Airbrush, or Pencil),
    Shift-click will draw a straight line from your last drawing
    point to your current cursor position.  If you also press Ctrl,
    the line will be constrained to 15 degree angles.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>
    The file selection dialog box has command-line completion with
    Tab, just like the shell.  Type part of a filename, hit tab, and voila!
    It's completed.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>
    You can reassign shortcut keys on any menu by bringing up the menu,
    selecting a menu item, and pressing the new shortcut key combination.
    This is dynamic and is saved when you exit GIMP.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>
    You can use the middle mouse button to pan around
    the image, if it's larger than its display window.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>
    Click and drag on a ruler to place a Guide on an image.  All
    dragged selections will snap to the guides.  You can remove
    guides by dragging them off the image with the Move tool.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>
    You can drag a layer from the &quot;Layers, Channels and Paths&quot; 
    dialog and drop it onto the toolbox.  This will create a new image
    containing only that layer.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>
    A Floating Selection must be anchored to a new layer or to the last
    active layer before doing other operations on the image.  Click on the
    New Layer or Anchor Layer buttons in the &quot;Layers, Channels and 
    Paths&quot; dialog, or use the menus to do the same.

    <_thetip>
    The GIMP supports gzip compression on the fly.  Just add
    &quot;.gz&quot; (or &quot;.bz2&quot;, if you have bzip2 installed) to 
    the filename and your image will be saved compressed.  Of course loading
    compressed images works too.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>    
    Pressing and holding the Shift key before making a selection allows
    you to add to the current selection instead of replacing it.  Using
    Ctrl before making a selection subtracts from the current one.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>    
    You can press or release the Shift and Ctrl keys while you are
    making a selection in order to constrain it to a perfect square
    or circle, or to have it centered on its starting point.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>    
    Using Edit-&gt;Stroke allows you to draw simple squares or circles by
    painting the edge of your current selection with the active brush.
    More complex shapes can be drawn with Filters-&gt;Render-&gt;Gfig.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>    
    If you stroke a path (Edit-&gt;Stroke), the current drawing tool and its
    settings are used.  You can use the Paintbrush in gradient mode, the
    Clone tool with a pattern or even the Eraser or the Smudge tool.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>    
    You can create and edit complex selections using the Bezier tool.
    The &quot;Paths&quot; tab in the &quot;Layers, Channels and Paths&quot; 
    dialog allows you to work on multiple paths and to convert them to 
    selections.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>    
    You can use the paint tools to change the selection.  Click on the
    Quick Mask button at the bottom left of an image window.  Change your
    selection by painting in the image and click on the button again to
    convert it back to a normal selection.
    </_thetip>  
  </tip>   
  <tip level="intermediate">
    <_thetip>    
    You can save a selection to a channel (Select-&gt;Save to Channel) and
    then modify this channel with any paint tools.  Using the buttons in
    the &quot;Channels&quot; tab of the &quot;Layers, Channels and 
    Paths&quot; dialog, you can toggle the visibility of this new channel 
    or convert it to a selection.

    If your fonts turn out blocky, that's because they're not scalable 
    fonts. Most X servers support scalable Type 1 Postscript fonts.  
    Download and install them.  Some font servers allow you to use 
    TrueType (.ttf) fonts, which are also scalable.

    To create a perfect circle, hold Shift while doing an ellipse select. 
    To place a circle precisely, drag horizontal and vertical guides
    tangent to the circle you want to select, place your cursor at the 
    intersection of the guides, and the resulting selection will just 
    touch the guides.

    If some of your scanned photos do not look colorful enough, you can
    easily improve their tonal range with the &quot;Auto&quot; button in 
    the Levels tool (Image-&gt;Colors-&gt;Levels).  If there are any color 
    casts, you can correct them with the Curves tool 
    (Image-&gt;Colors-&gt;Curves).
