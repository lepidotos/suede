	* NEWS: Updated for 0.14 release.
	* configure.in: Bump to 0.14.

2002-01-29  ERDI Gergo  <cactus@cactus.rulez.org>

	* intltool.m4: use AC_DIVERT to access config.status only when the
	AC_DIVERSION_ICMDS macro is defined, and revert to
	AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS_PRE when not (closes: #69991)

=== intltool 0.13 ===

2002-01-28  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* NEWS: Updated for 0.13 release.
	* intltool.m4: Tweak comment.

2002-01-28  Ross Golder  <ross@golder.org>

	* configure.in: Updated popt URL.

2002-01-25  ERDI Gergo  <cactus@cactus.rulez.org>

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: 
	* intltool.m4: Since AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS_PRE is an Autoconf
	2.50-only feature, use the AC_DIVERSION_ICMDS diversion instead,
	to modify po/POTFILES in the config.status script

2002-01-24  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool.m4: Tweak comments.

2002-01-24  ERDI Gergo  <cactus@cactus.rulez.org>

	* intltool.m4: Remove intltool [] tags from POTFILES 

2002-01-22  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool-merge.in.in: Don't use NDBM_File unless the
	environment variable tells us to.

2002-01-21  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool-merge.in.in: Kenneth implemented a cache to
	make merging much faster. But we don't have a complete
	solution about where to put the cache. For now, you can
	turn on the cache by setting the environment variable
	INTLTOOL_USE_CACHE.

	* intltool-update.in.in: Formatting tweak.

2002-01-16  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool-update.in.in:
	Mostly changes by Kenneth Christiansen <kenneth@gnu.org>.
	This is an attempt to fix a bug in intltool -M where it
	doesn't find glade files containing translatable strings.
	Some other miscellaneous cleanups too.

2002-01-16  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* USED: Add gnome-games.

2002-01-07  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool-update.in.in: Look at both POTFILES.in and POTFILE.ignore.

2002-01-06  Juan Pablo Mendoza <jpablo@gnome.org>

	* intltool-update.in.in:
	* intltool.m4:

	Added suport for caves files (gnome-games/gnome-stones/*.caves),
	theses are just like desktop files.

	From Edgar Luna:

	* intltool-prepare.in (contains): chomp the readed
	  line since it may contain stuff like \n and so.

2001-12-31  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* NEWS: Oops, 0.12 already went out.
	* configure.in: Bump to 0.13.

	trouble when desktop file entries have metacharacters in them.

2001-11-13  Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@gnome-db.org>

	* USED: gedit's HEAD use now intltool.

	if present.

2001-11-06  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool-prepare.in: Fix bug where it used a regex when all
	we want to do was compare two strings.

2001-11-03  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool-merge.in.in: Better fix for the the "C++ file" problem.
	Some code simplification.

2001-10-29  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* intltool-merge.in.in (keys_merge_translations): line from stric
	to not choke on things like "C++ file"

	* intltool-po-Makefile.in.in-patch-3: add back top_builddir
	definition because $INTLTOOL_UPDATE refers to it

2001-10-29  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool-merge.in.in:
	Major rewrite. Handle entities better, handle multiline entries
	in .po files better. Handle multiple translations within the
	same element in an oaf-style file better.

	* tests/cases/merge6.po: Fix test case since we now decode entities
	properly for the .po file entries.

	* tests/cases/test.po: Remove _File test case since it requires
	something we haven't even designed -- translating attributes for a
	non-empty XML node. Change merge7 part of test to use a more realistic
	msgstr line.

	* tests/results/merge1.xml: Add all the translations that the old
	version was failing to include.

	* tests/results/merge7.xml: Took out some whitespace that is no longer
	preserved by the merging process.

2001-10-29  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* intltool-update.in.in: add support for a --gettext-package
	argument

	* Makefile.am (pkgdata_DATA): add glib-gettextize'd patch

2001-10-26  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* doc-i18n-tool/Makefile.am:
	Oops. Not so easy to turn something off.

2001-10-26  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* Makefile.am: Turn off compiling of doc-i18n-tool as an
	interim measure so people using eazel-hacking can build.
	Soon, we can make this a configure-time option and change
	eazel-hacking to use that.

2001-10-24  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool.spec.in: Set up mandir (thanks Toralf Lund)

Mon Oct 22 19:39:39 2001  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* autogen.sh: fix message now that we compile.

Mon Oct 22 17:31:26 2001  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

2001-10-16  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool-merge.in.in: Remove whitespace in a way that
	matches what intltool-extract does.

	* intltool-extract.in.in:

	Removed a redundant test.

2001-10-09  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool-extract.in.in: Remove excess whitespace.
	Still nowhere near real XML parsing, but better than
	before for multi-line XML.

	* tests/cases/.cvsignore:
	* tests/cases/Makefile.am:
	* tests/cases/extract7.xml:

2001-10-05  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool.spec.in: Second try.

2001-10-05  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool.spec.in: A naive cut at adding "Provides"
	so that RPMs can ask for xml-i18n-tools and get us and
	be satisfied.

2001-10-04  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 0.11.1 so that cvs will
	be newer than the released version.

=== intltool 0.11 ===

2001-10-04  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* NEWS: More news, release will be 0.11, not 0.10.
	* configure.in: Bump version number.

	* tests/cases/Makefile.am: Add missing files so "make
	distcheck" passes.
	* tests/results/Makefile.am: Add missing files so "make
	distcheck" passes.

	* tests/selftest.pl.in: Do the tests in the destination

	Back to GPL.

2001-10-03  Peter Williams  <peterw@ximian.com>

	* intltoolize.in: Define $intltool_m4 because it's supposed to
	be defined.

	* xml-i18n-toolize.in: Analogous fix.

2001-10-03  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* COPYING.LIB: Maciej says that switching to LGPL was a mistake.
	I'll remove this, and he'll fix the licenses in the source files.

2001-10-02  Kenneth Christiansen  <kenneth@gnu.org>

	* intltool-*: Changed license, and s/xml-i18n-tools/intltool/;
	* COPYING.LIB: New file describing the LGPL licence 

2001-10-02  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

2001-10-02  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* intltool.m4:
	* xml-i18n-tools.m4:
	Fix mistake where the whitespace screws up the macros.

2001-10-01  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	First cut at all the name changes to call it intltool.
	If you use the new m4 macros, everything defaults to doing it the
	right way for gnome 2 (using UTF-8 everywhere).

2001-10-01  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: A bit more cleanup in here.

2001-10-01  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: Fix longstanding problem where the merge rule
	doesn't work if you don't have any .po files by using $(wildcard)
	inside the make rules.

2001-09-29  Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@gnome-db.org>
	
	* USED: Added ganimal.

2001-09-25  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* xml-i18n-merge.in.in: Added a comment.

2001-09-24  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: Used % instead of \%. It turns out that
	the reason the backslash was needed before was a subtle consequence
	of using two lines in our macro expansions. Now that we have single
	lines, we don't need the \ any more. Took me a long time to figure
	that one out. Also use plain old AC_SUBST -- the HACK_SUBST is not
	needed any more now that we have 1-line expansions.

2001-09-23  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* xml-i18n-extract.in.in:
	* xml-i18n-merge.in.in:
	* xml-i18n-update.in.in:
	Remove "-?" option as a way to get help for compatibility with
	older versions of perl (or is it older versions of a perl lib?).
	Patch contributed by drk@sgi.com.

2001-09-23  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* xml-i18n-update.in.in: Ignore comment lines when reading
	POTFILES.in -- fixes bug 60999.

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: Whitespace tweak.

2001-09-19  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* tests/cases/test.po: Removed a troublesome test case. We don't
	really need to handle cases where we escape a non-reserved character.

	* xml-i18n-merge.in.in: Fix escape logic so it's clear that it won't
	be confused by partial escape sequences. Also remove the absurd code
	that turns "\n" into "n".

2001-09-19  Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@gnome-db.org>

	* xml-i18n-tools.spec.in: fixes from jgotts@linuxsavvy.com
	(kenneth sended me this patch)
	* xml-i18n-update.in.in
	* xml-i18n-extract.in.in: Added .scm support from old intltool code
	from kenneth and scripts from gimp.

2001-09-19  Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@gnome-db.org>

	* Added the changes from kenneth (intltool rel 0.9.5)

2001-09-18  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: Fixed the long-standing "split line"
	bug by just using semicolons instead of newlines. I have
	no idea why we didn't think of this before.

	* xml-i18n-prepare.in: A few simplifications.

2001-09-09  Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@gnome-db.org>

	* doc/*: Added the manpages from intltool. They aren't
	installed yet because I have only changed /s/intl/xml-i18n-/
	and they need more work and also the script need more
	options from intltool. I'm working on it, please be patient.
	
2001-09-02  Robin * Slomkowski  <rslomkow@rslomkow.org>

	* tests/cases/Makefile.am: changed extract1.desktop.in
	to extract1.desktop as the .in file did not exist.

2001-09-01  Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@gnome-db.org>

	* xml-i18n-update.in.in: Fixed the .server support.

2001-08-26  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: Don't touch the xml-i18n-* scripts when they
	haven't really changed. This reduces the amount of redundant
	re-translating that happens if you rerun configure, something I
	do a lot.

2001-08-24  Zbigniew Chyla  <cyba@gnome.pl>

	* xml-i18n-update.in.in: Appended "--keyword=U_" to the list of
	parameters passed to xgettext.
	U_() is used in Evolution to get UTF-8 string from current (probably
	non-utf) translation domain.
	Of course this is useful only in GNOME 1.x apps.

	* README: s/XML_UTF8_XML_KIND/XML_I18N_XML_KIND/

2001-08-19  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@noisehavoc.org>

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: Remove buggy check for xml-i18n-tools 0.9 or
	greater. First of all, ./xml-i18n-merge is not generated until
	after configure runs, so running it inside configure is not a good
	idea. The check won't do much anyway since if you have the version
	of the m4 file that requires 0.9, you must also have 0.9 itself.

2001-08-19  Cyrille Chepelov  <chepelov@calixo.net>

	* xml-i18n-merge.in.in: (get_po_encoding): more resilient regex as
	advised by Darin. (unescape_po_string): unescaped \\ too.
	Refactored the regex. (entity_encode): removed the \ handling.
		
	* tests/selftest.pl.in: re-aligned the [OK] notices and put them a
	bit further on the right side.

	* tests/cases/merge6.(xml.in|po):
	* tests/results/merge6.xml: included more tests on escapes.

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: Added a second, optional parameter. If this
	is equal to G2 (as in "GNOME 2.0 or better"), then there is no
	variable behaviour based on the value of $XML_I18N_XML_KIND or
	_KEYS_KIND. All _MERGE_.*_RULEs have been marked as using -p for
	G1, -u for G2 if nothing better was known. (OAF is -p only)
	* NEWS:
	* README: documented the above capability.
	
2001-08-18  Cyrille Chepelov  <chepelov@calixo.net>

	* xml-i18n-merge.in.in: (get_po_encoding): put a warning and a
	default if the charset spec is absent. 
	(entity_encode_sane): renamed to entity_encode_int_minimalist.
	(entity_encode_int): renamed to entity_encode_int_even_high_bit.
		
	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: (XML_I18N_MERGE_SERVER_RULE): use --utf8.
	(XML_I18N_MERGE_KEYS_RULE): use $(XML_I18N_KEYS_KIND).

	* NEWS:
	* README: updated to mention XML_I18N_KEYS_KIND
	
2001-08-18  Cyrille Chepelov  <chepelov@calixo.net>

	* xml-i18n-merge.in.in: added two new flags, --pass-through(-p)
	and --utf8(-u). The former asks for previous XML behaviour, the
	latter complies better with the XML spec. If neither is asked,
	xml-i18n-merge.in.in will complain vehemently but do -p.

	* xml-i18n-tools.m4: updated all MERGE_.*_RULE macros to use -p
	where not sure, -u for _SHEET_RULE, and
	developer-specificable behaviour for _XML_RULE. Added an optional
	minimum version parameter (FIXME: how to detect "very old" (up to
	0.9) xml-i18n-tools ?)

	* NEWS: updated (put a reference to the README)
	* README: documented the XML_I18N_XML_KIND variable in the XML section.
	Didn't document .sheet files, given their specificity.
	
	* tests/cases/fr.po (REMOVED):
	* tests/cases/fr_BE.po (NEW):
	* tests/cases/fr_FR.po (NEW):
	split into two identical versions, one encoded in UTF-8 and one in
	ISO-8859-1.
	* tests/cases/az.po (NEW): UTF-8 encoded Azerbaijani version of
	the above. AZ is normally not represented using latin1, so this is
	a valuable test case.
	
	* tests/cases/merge5.sheet.in(REMOVED):
	* tests/cases/merge5u.sheet.in(NEW):

	* tests/cases/merge6.sheet.in(NEW):

	* tests/cases/merge6.po(NEW):
	* selftest.pl.in: updated the test case 7, split into tests 7u and
	7p, to check for both --pass-through and --utf8 behaviours. Test 8
	added to check for PO string unescaping.

	* tests/cases/Makefile.am:
	* tests/results/Makefile.am: forgot to update these.
	
2001-08-17  Cyrille Chepelov  <chepelov@calixo.net>

	* xml-i18n-update.in.in: Now understands .sheet files (dia) are
	XML files.
	* USED: added dia.	

	* tests/cases/.cvsignore:
	* tests/cases/merge5.sheet.in (NEW): 
	* tests/cases/fr.po (NEW):
	* tests/results/merge5.sheet (NEW):
	* tests/selftest.pl.in: Added a new test case for dia sheet files
	merging, and correctness with respect to UTF-8 encoding in XML
	files. It would be excellent if someone from a non-latin1 language
	could update this test ! 
	Please note that this test currently fails.

	2.50.

	causing problems with Tinderbox.

2001-05-09  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* Makefile.am: SUBDIRS included "." for a good reason. That's
	the only way to make sure the scripts are built before the
	tests directory. The problem was actually a bug in automake
	1.3 -- this program requires automake 1.4.

2001-05-09  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Rolled all the changes from the stable branch to here. We're
	going to stop using the stable branch and just develop on HEAD.

	2001-05-09  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 8274 (autogen.sh creates recursive makefile on Solaris):

	* Makefile.am: For some reason, SUBDIRS included "." -- no wonder
	the makefile went on forever!

	* tests/cases/.cvsignore: Ignore a generated file.

	2001-05-08  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	passes.

	2001-05-02  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* xml-i18n-po-Makefile.in.in-patch-2: New version of the gettext
	0.10.36 (and newer) patch contributed by Stanislav Brabec
	<utx@penguin.cz>.

	2001-04-27  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	A first try at making xml-i18n-tools compatible with the new
	gettext 0.10.36. I created a new patch and make the toolize
	script choose the appropriate patch based on the file contents.

	* xml-i18n-tools.Makefile.patch:
	* xml-i18n-po-Makefile.in.in-patch-1:
	Renamed the old patch.

	* xml-i18n-po-Makefile.in.in-patch-2:
	Checked in a new patch that works with gettext 0.10.36.

	* xml-i18n-toolize.in:
	Added code to use patch2 if "builddir" appears in the file
	and patch1 if it doesn't.

	* Makefile.am:
	Add the new files.

	* xml-i18n-merge.in.in (xml_merge_translations)

	modules when xml-i18n-toolizing.
	* xml-i18n-toolize.in: copy .in versions of tools into module.
	* xml-i18n-tools.Makefile.patch: don't change DISTFILES, this

2001-01-31  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* tests/selftest.pl: Use the "srcdir" environment variable

	gettext/ini means that it should use the

	Fix bug 5454 (Translators have to run ./autogen.sh in each module
	they work on).

	* Makefile.am: Install xml-i18n-update and xml-i18n-extract, so

	by doing `xml-i18n-update <lang>' with the xml-i18n-tools package
	installed.
	
	* xml-i18n-update.in: Translators have to run ./autogen.sh in each
	module they work on. Find installed xml-i18n-extract as well as
	the one in the source tree, for purposes of running on
	non-autogen'd modules.
