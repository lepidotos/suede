2001-05-31  Peter Teichman  <peter@ximian.com>

	* gtcd.c, keybindings.c, popup.c, prefs.c, prefs.h: fix keybinding

	numeric key codes. Patch from 
	David Hampton <hampton@employees.org>

	reloading function. Fixes a segfault. Patch from
	David Hampton <hampton@employees.org>

	David Hampton <hampton@employees.org> 

2001-05-29  Peter Teichman  <peter@ximian.com>

	return values were never checked anyway

	* linux-cdrom.c: return nothing in tcd_readtoc and tcd_playtracks,
	rather than uninitialized variables
	
2001-05-29  Peter Teichman  <peter@ximian.com>

	David Hampton <hampton@employees.org>

2001-05-28  Peter Teichman  <peter@ximian.com>

	* callbacks.c (quit_cb): remove the two timeouts while shutting
	down. this fixes a race condition where the gc was destroyed
	before the slow timeout ran

	* gtcd.c: Create a corba interface for gtcd, to ensure that only
	one copy is running at a time

	* gtcd.c, prefs.h, prefs.c: Try much harder to load a font. Patch
	from David Hampton <hampton@employees.org>

	* linux-cdrom.c (tcd_playtracks): Removed leftover from
	Stanislav's commit on Dec 19. (duplicate assignment without
	effect).

	* linux-cdrom.c: Committed fix for bug #33600 from Norbert Warmuth
	<nwarmuth@privat.circular.de> (tcd/gtcd fails to play some CD's on
	linux).

2000-08-05  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

	* doc/*: Added C documentation for Erik Jarvi
	* callbacks.c: Modified help callback to use help browser and	
	point to new docs instead of old users guide

2000-05-21  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gtcd.c (main): set the default icon

	* prefs.c (font_button_cb): 
	* gtracked.c (edit_window):

Fri May 12 11:44:31 2000  Tim Gerla <timg@rrv.net>

	* gtcd.c: Hopefully fix a phantom crash..

Tue Apr 18 14:28:31 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtcd.c, prefs.c: use gdk_fontset_load for everything, mark all
	  font strings as translatable and make -iso8859-1 into -*-*.  This
	  should make it work for other-then-english

Tue Apr 18 13:40:42 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gtcd.c: apply a patch that tim approved about 3 months ago and
	  I forgot to apply it: change cur_goto_id to unsigned long, and
	  free the gotomenu when redoing it.  This fixes tcd on alpha.

	* gtracked.c: use static buffers instead of dynamic for printing
	  into the clist.  It was mallocing a constant amount here anyway.
	  (part of the above patch as well)

2000-04-16  Karl EICHWALDER  <ke@suse.de>

	* gtcd.desktop: Add `de'.

2000-04-02  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gtcd.c (setup_time_display): minor packing changes to make it
	look better.
	(init_window): change allow_shrink to be false.  Fizes one of my
	biggest gripes with GNOME of all time.
	(create_buttons): fixed keyboard handling of buttons.

2000-02-14  Stanislav Brabec <utx@penguin.cz>

	* Makefile.am: Removed obsolette -g.

2000-01-13  Tim Gerla  <timg@means.net>

2000-01-13  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@po.cwru.edu>

	* linux-cdrom.c (tcd_playtracks): do a bunch more defined() tests
	so it comiles with linux 2.0.38

	* gtcd.c (launch_gmix): use the mixer_cb instead of forking gmix
	(let mixer_cb handle that so it's all done in one place)

2000-01-10  Tim Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* linux-cdrom.c (tcd_playtracks): Patch from Ben Collver to clean up
	                                  some kernel warnings.

	* gtracked.c (select_row_cb): Erase stuff in entry if it starts with
	                              "Track".

1999-07-11  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	Fix compile problems on Solaris. 
	* linux-cdrom.h (cd_min_sec_frame): New typedef.  Equivalent to 
	the type used for cdrom_tocentry::cdte_addr.msf.  
	(CD_FRAMES, CD_SECS): Define if not already defined.
	* linux-cdrom.c (msf_2_frame): Use cd_min_sec_frame instead of
	cdrom_msf0.
	(frame_2_msf): Likewise.
	(tcd_play_seconds): Likewise.
	Reported by "Brandon S. Allbery" <allbery@ece.cmu.edu>.
	
1999-05-25  Tim Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* Added patch from AJG to allow --device=/dev/whatever to be passed
	to the command line.

1999-05-24  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* cddb.c (append_data): I was using the strncat function
	incorrectly.  This caused buffer overruns for large ammounts of
	extended data.  It now truncates the data like it was supposed to.
	It may be a good idea to switch over to dynamically allocated
	strings for this code, so that we don't loose information in these
	situations.

1999-05-11  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* prefs.c (load_prefs): set the default cddb host to freedb.

	* cddb_props.c: small change to the logic for changing the default
	port when switching between cddbp and http mode for lookups -- freedb
	uses port 888 for cddbp, while cddb.com uses 8880.

	* gtracked.c (gtracked_submit): use gnome_config_get_translated_string
	to read the description of the submit service, so that translations
	can be made.

	* gtcd.c (setup_time_display): added a tooltip to the volume slider.

	* cddb.c (tcd_readcddb, tcd_writecddb): now the DTITLE and TTITLEn
	fields of an entry will be split onto multiple lines if they are too
	long.  Without this change, CDs with long song titles would get
	rejected when submited to one of the cddb databases.

1999-05-02  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtracked.c (gtracked_submit): was leaking the section names when
	iterating over the file cddb-submit-methods.

	* gtcd.c (slow_timer): fixed a memory leak.  The return value of
	gnome_util_home_file was not being freed.  This was causing gtcd to
	leak one string every second -- not good if you leave gtcd running.
	Now the malloc/free difference seems to be stable (except when you
	bring up any dialogs).

1999-04-30  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtracked.c (gtracked_submit): coded the dialog used to submit
	entries to cddb servers.

	* cddb.h (tcd_call_cddb_submit): added function prototype.

	* cddb.c (tcd_readcddb): read the revision number from the cddb file.
	(tcd_writecddb): write the revision back to the file.

	* linux-cdrom.c (tcd_readdiskinfo): set cd->cddb_rev to zero for
	unknown discs.

	* linux-cdrom.h (cd_struct): added cddb_rev field to hold the revision
	of a cddb database file.  We need to worry about this for submission
	purposes.

1999-04-29  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gtracked.c: many changes to allow editing the extra information
	fields for the disc and track.  Now not only does gtcd not destroy
	this information, it allows you to edit it.  The dialog is about
	40% larger as a result, but still should fit on a 640x480 screen.
	I have also added a submit button, for the submit code I have
	almost finished.

	* cddb.c (tcd_call_cddb_submit): new function to call cddbsubmit.

	* cddb.c (tcd_readcddb): added code to read extended data from the
	cddbslave database files.  It recognises multiple line data, and
	handles embedded new lines, tabs and back slashes correctly.
	The PLAYORDER tag is still ignored, since gtcd doesn't use it (yet).
	(tcd_writecddb): added code to write the extended data back to
	cddbslave database files.  It handles breaking long lines and
	escaping new lines, tabs and back slashes.
	Now gtcd will preserve all the information in a cddb record.

	* linux-cdrom.c (tcd_readdiskinfo): set the extd members to empty
	strings when initialising the structure for a disc with no cddbslave
	database entry.

	* linux-cdrom.h (cd_track, cd_struct): added extended data fields to
	these structures (the new extd members).

	* cddb.c (tcd_writecddb): modified this function so that it outputs
	valid cddb data files.  Basically just changed PLAYLIST= to PLAYORDER=
	and added blank EXTD and EXTTn lines.  I will have to get it so that
	these fields are read in properly, so that gtcd does not wipe this
	data if it exists in the file.

1999-04-17  James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>

	* prefs.[ch]: added some code to load and save http specific cddb
	settings

	* cddb_props.c: added code for http cddb settings.

1999-03-15  Mark Crichton <crichton@gimp.org>
	
	* linux-cdrom.h: Wasnt that, reverted change

1999-03-15  Mark Crichton <crichton@gimp.org>
	
	* linux-cdrom.h: Fixed the annoying Illegal Request error popping
	up on my machine.  CDROMCLOSETRAY is only for the OPTI series of
	cdroms.  So we now check to see if CONFIG_OPTCD(_MODULE) is defined.
	If it isn't, we undefine CDROMCLOSETRAY.  Works with Linux 2.2 only.

1999-03-10  Ian Peters  <itp@gnu.org>

	* gtcd.c: (main): Set the display area's background color to black,
	which makes assorted redraws nicer.

1999-02-26  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@adam.kaist.ac.kr>

	* cddb_props.c (create_local_db): Translate N_()'ed strings.
	(fill_list): Likewise.

1999-02-17  drmike  <drmike@marshank>

        * Makefile.am: Updated to install desktop into $(datadir)/gnome/apps

        Dr Mike <drmike@redhat.com>

1999-02-13  pablo  <pablo@marshank>

        * prefs.c, linux-cdrom.c, cddb_props.c: updated spanish language file,
        and some i18n corrections

1999-02-11  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* gtcd.c: Fixed sizing for mandrake.
	* linux-cdrom.[ch]: Fixed malloc brokenness

1999-02-10  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* gtcd.c(reload_info): Fix cddb reload.
	* gtracked.c: Fix cd changer switching.

1999-02-09  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* Small fixups. Reload track info every 5 seconds.
	* gtcd.c: remove ~/.tcd/gtkrc parsing, not needed...

1999-02-08  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* tcd.c: Ditch isdisk and hopefully fix tcd.
	* linux-cdrom.c: Various policy changes..will probably break tcd
	(not gtcd). 
	* gtcd.c: Remove isdisk
	* gtcd.c: Changed window size policy. Now it sizes to fit the
	largest of either album title or artist, or 25 characters,
	whichever is smaller. Wraps song names like "This is...long
	song". 

1999-01-28  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* prefs.c: Added only_use_trkind preference for broken cdrom drives,
		   lowercased some options. 
	* linux-cdrom.c: Made only_use_trkind an option.

1999-01-28  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* prefs.c/gtracked.c: Clicking on Track Editor or Preferences when
	  a window is already open, closes the respective window.

1999-01-28  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* gtcd.c/linux-cdrom.c: Fixed disc change checking logic. Still a
	bit messy, but it works. 

1999-01-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* tcd.c (main): Make C-l refresh the display.

Sun Dec 27 00:42:53 CST 1998  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* gtcd.c (slow_timer): SIGUSR2 not 1

1998-12-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* cddb_status.c (cddb_status_dialog): Remove exploitable hole.  Do
	not use /tmp, and fixes a bug that will allow multiple users to
	use this. 

1998-12-16  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@po.cwru.edu>

	* cddb.c (tcd_call_cddb_slave): Decrement blen on 1st sprintf.
	Change some >= to > to account for trailing 0 added by 1st
	sprintf.  Should probably modify size of buf to allow for disc's
	with 99 tracks!

1998-12-13  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* gtracked.c (edit_window): Select a track on open so that the
	user isn't confused.
	Also update track editor when disc is changed.

	* cddb_props.c: Various fixes.

	* cddb_status.c (cddb_status_dialog): It works once again.

	* prefs.c: Only one dialog may be open at once. 
	Also removed key modifiers.

1998-12-11  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* cddb_status.c: Works now!

	* cddb_props.c (create_cddb_page): Made server and port work.

1998-12-11  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* fixed the color preferences callback: GnomeColorPicker
	returns 16bit color values. 

1998-12-02  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* gtcd.c: Fixed another silly segfault.

	* cddb_props.[ch]: New toys! Not all features working yet.

	* Internationalization updates

1998-11-22  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@fun112.koivukyla.hoas.fi>

	* updated the icon into a little better one.. Compact Disk is a tough
	one to draw :) Maybe I should make an entirely different thing...?

1998-11-20  Tuomas Lukka (lukka@iki.fi)

	* put in internalization for the "normal", "trk-e" etc strings.

1998-11-8  Justin Maurer  <justin@openprojects.net>

	* fixed popup.c to popup preferences dialog instead of track editor
	when preferences is clicked

1998-09-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* prefs.c (color_set_cb): Use guint not int for args, and 
	do the function differently since get_i8 no longer takes int* args
	and it might leave the last 3/4 of the int empty. This callback 
	function is missing the alpha argument, btw.

1998-09-22  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* prefs.c, gtcd.c, keybindings.[ch]: New fun properties tab.

1998-09-19  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* gtcd.c (create_buttons): Remove _() from pixmap name because it
	is now a picture instead of a word.

Sun Aug 30 21:06:10 1998  Tim P. Gerla	<timg@means.net>

	* cddb.c: Removed many function calls that were replaced by

	* socket.c: Added a select to make things a bit more
	  responsive...Still not quite right.

1998-08-26  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* properties.c, gtracked.c, gtcd.c: More i18n work.

1998-08-25  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* gtcd.c: Fastforward/rewind buttons now work as a real CD player
	  would. Click and release to change track, hold to skip seconds. 
	* linux-cdrom.c: Split tcd_gettime() into two parts.

	* TODO: a few changes.

	* tcd/Makefile.am: Support for above. 

	* tcd/gcddb.c: Changed sprintfs to g_snprintfs.

	* tcd/gtracked.c: Fixed some silly bug that manifested itself when I
	  enabled changer support.

	* tcd/gtcd.c: Changed sprintfs to g_snprintfs, and removed several
          superfluous gtk_show_widgets. Fixed changer box packing order.
	  Also set volume widget to fill&expand.

	* gabout.c, gtcd.c, gcddb.c: Some i18n work.

1998-08-04  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtcd.c (status_configure_event): Fixed the leak that was causing
	the X server to grow to an infinite size -- the status_db pixmap
	was being recreated on every configure event but it was never
	being freed.

	* properties.c (create_status_frame): Fixed erroneous printf format.
	(help_cb): Made void, as it had no return type.
	#include <string.h>

	* gcddb.c (do_cddb): Do not pass more than one parameter to
	tcd_open_cddb_http(). 
	#include <stdlib.h> and <string.h>
	(do_cddb): Made void, as the function is not supposed to return

	* gtracked.c: #include <string.h>

	* linux-cdrom.c (tcd_readdiskinfo): Return 0 when the disk is not
	playable. 

	* cddb.h: Added prototype for tcd_open_cddb_http().

	* gtcd.c (status_changed): Made void, as the function does not
	return anything.

	* Removed unused variables all over the place to keep gcc happy.

	* gtcd.c: Added prototype for status_changed().

	* properties.h: Added prototype for properties_cb().

	* gtracked.h: Added prototype for edit_window().

	* gtcd.c (make_button_with_pixmap):
	(make_row3): 
	(setup_pixmaps): 
	(status_changed): Fixed memory leaks caused by not freeing the
	string returned by gnome_pixmap_file().

	* gtracked.c: Fixed silly clist bug. Now the tracks won't be
	corrupted. 

1998-07-02  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* gtcd.desktop: Added Portuguese translation.
