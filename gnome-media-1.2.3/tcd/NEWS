Gnome-media 0.30 release new stuff:

* RMB popup menu, click on the time display.
* Keybindings code.
* New cddb setup. TCD will automatically call the little slave 'cddbslave',
and request the info. No user intervention is needed. As a result, you can't
yet configure the cddb server, or use http/proxy services. This is being
fixed.
* More bug fixes, etc...

Totally screwed the interface over again. Please comment.

CVS commits:
*: Major UI changes, please comment. timg@means.net.
        - Now uses the LED widget from the cdplayer applet.
        - Shrunk the display slightly, moved the titles to the display
                widget.
        (You *will* be able to change the time display mode, from track
        remaining, track elasped, disc remaining, and disc elapsed. It's
        at track remaining, now.)
        (You will also be able to modify the color of the various UI parts.
        The color selectors in the properties box don't do anything now.)

*: Many bug fixes, mainly in linux-cdrom.c.


TCD 2.0
 * Woohoo! Final release of 2.0!
 * Fixed gcddb.c to report if no exact matches are found.
 * The segfault bug should be fixed, I added some array checks.
 * Moved tooltip defines to tooltips.h. Broke TT_TIME? why?
 * More Various fixes.
 * Switched to using gtk.m4 for the configure script.
 * (hopefully) fixed the end-of-cd segfault bug!
 * Many little buglet fixes.

TCD 2.0b2
 * Added tooltips
 * Dropped CPU usage a lot in gtcd.
 * Bunch of small bugfixes, particularly in the track/title display code
 * Fixed up tcd's rewind code a bit
 * tcd's volume control doesn't wrap around anymore
 * Now uses the configure script.
 * Added simple support for icon themes. Check icons/README.
 * Readded the manpage. Seems Debian's guidelines require one, and I want
   TCD to be Debianized. :)
 * Improved the cddb dialog, making the cancel button work somewhat.
 * Fixed the repeat track code. It didn't work on the last track.

TCD 2.0b
 * Ditched the manpage. Who reads those things anyway? :)
 * Everything's different.
 * Gtk version is in the works, called 'gtcd', at version 0.5.
 * CDDB Remote added.
 * TCD now will allow you to resume play without exiting the player
   after a CD has been ejected.
 * Added volume control.
 * Fixed many small bugs.
 * Fixed the track editor for CDs with more tracks than could fit on the
   display
 * Removed the last few global variables in cdrom.c, now it's completly
   self-contained, most functions only need to be passed a cd_struct.
   This modularity allowed me to write the X11 interface with no problems.
 * Moved the track name display to the other side of the screen, so more of
   the name could be seen. Patch by Andreas Persenius.
 * Fixed some overflows with the track database, reported by 
   Boris Tobotras.
 * Added a minimum screen size check. (David E.)
 * (Hopefully) Fixed the problem with the reverse-video not showing 
   up sometimes.
 * Switched tcd_init_disc() with init_curses(), thanks to
   Jesse Thilo, David Ellsworth, and Erik Andersen for reporting this problem!
   PS. Why does it matter?
 * Removed many of the global vars in cdrom.c.
 
TCD 1.0 Released 09/02/97

 * Many changes to the UI.
 * Added O_NONBLOCK to the open call in cdrom.c... See
   /usr/src/linux/Documentation/cdrom.tex for rational.
 * Fixed (E)ject and (S)top (they didn't exist!!)
 * Added LOTS more error handling
 * Modularized the source code. You could use cdrom.c in an X player, for
   example. 
 * Added the track name database!
 
TCD 0.8b Released 08/26/97

 * First public release
