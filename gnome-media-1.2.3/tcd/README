TCD v2.0, (C) 1997-98 Tim Gerla <timg@means.net>
Relased 03/05/98

**************************************************************************
FEATURES:

* TCD has two interfaces: one Curses based, the other Gtk+ based.
  Gtk+ is an excellent X11 widget set, and if you don't have it, get it.
  TCD requires Gtk+ version 0.99.3 or later. Please see 
  http://www.gimp.org/gtk/ for more info.
* Simple, sensible, one-keystroke control. 
	(No more mapping little icons to your keypad!) :)
* Repeat track, continuous play control.
* Supports remote download of disc information from CDDB servers
  worldwide. See http://www.cddb.com/ for more info.
* Local CDDB database in ~/.tcd/

***************************************************************************
COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION:

Please see INSTALL for compilation instructions.

Be sure you have permission to access the cdrom drive, /dev/cdrom.

NOTE: You may have to change the -lncurses in the toplevel Makefile for some
Linux distributions.

***************************************************************************
HOW TO USE THE CURSES INTERFACE:

Once you've successfully installed tcd, and made sure it can access your CD
device, go ahead and run tcd as a regular user. 

A nice-looking (imho) screen will come up, with some stats and a track list
on the left side. On the right side you will see a list of keys, and what
they do. Most of them should be self-explanatory, but here are what a few
more obscure ones do:

[M] - Change play method.	TCD can play the CD normally, repeat the
entire CD when the end is reached, or repeat a specific track. Press 'M' to
cycle through these modes.

[T] - Edit track database.	This allows you to edit the track names and
artist/album information. This information is stored in $HOME/.tcd/, with
one file per CD. The track editor is fairly self-explanatory. Press 'E' to
edit a track. If there are too many tracks to display on one page, press '+'
and '-' to change pages. 

Now, back to the main screen...
***************************************************************************
TRACK LIST:

You'll see a list of tracks on the left side of your display, looking
something like this:

01  - 03:44 |
02  - 04:00 |
03  - 04:25 |
04  - 01:56 |
05P - 04:02 |
06  - 02:43 |
...

The first number is the track, the second two are the total length of the
track, in the minute:second format. If there are too many tracks for one
line, it's continued a bit over to the right. 

You'll see either a 'P', 'D', 'R', or an 'a' directly after the track
number. Here's what they mean:

'P': This track is currently playing.
'D': This is a data track, and can't be played. :P
'R': This track is playing, and being repeated.
'a': This is an inactive audio track.

You can have up to 30 tracks per 80x25 screen, more with larger screens. If
there are more than 30 tracks on the CD, the tracks will just go off the
screen. :( You'll still be able to play them, though.

--
Well, that's about it. The Gtk version should be just as easy to figure out, 
if not easier.

If you see any improvements that you would like to see in TCD, PLEASE give
me an email. :)
