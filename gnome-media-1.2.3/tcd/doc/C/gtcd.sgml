   The <application>GNOME CD Player</application> (<command>gtcd</command>) is
   a GNOME enabled application that is preloaded with GNOME. This is a simple 
   CD Player which allows you to listen to compact discs on your PC.

      You must have the correct access rights to your CDROM drive for this
      application to be successful. Some systems will normally grant you the
      necessary rights automatically when you log into the console. The
      mechanism that does this is called the
      <application>pam_console</application>. If your system doesn't give you
      the necessary rights to the CDROM, then you will need to be given those
      rights. If you have the root password type the following in a terminal
      window.
      <screen>  
      <prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>su</userinput> 
      <prompt>$</prompt> <replaceable>Password: [type in root password]
      </replaceable> 
      <prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>chmod a+r /dev/cdrom</userinput>
      <prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>exit</userinput>
     </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
     If your CDROM is located somewhere other than 
     <filename>/dev/cdrom</filename> make sure you change it in the commands 
     above.

    The <application>GNOME CD Player</application> works like any CD Player
    with common buttons such as Play, Stop, Pause, etc. Plus a 
    <guibutton>track selector</guibutton> 
    button that displays the track titles in a drop down menu. By pressing the
    <guilabel>track number</guilabel> in the window, you can change the looping
    features. There are three settings <guilabel>normal</guilabel>, 
    <guilabel>loop-cd</guilabel>, and <guilabel>loop-t</guilabel> 
    (which is loop track). By pressing the <guilabel>track time</guilabel> you 
    change the track/disk elapsed/remaining.

    You can change various properties by pressing the

      the key bindings associated with the
      <application>GNOME CD Player</application>.
      These keybindings allow you to use the Player without using your mouse. 
      If you want to change one of the bindings, select it with your mouse and 
      type the new key in the <guilabel>Click here to change</guilabel> text box.

     <para>
      <guilabel>CDDB Settings Tab</guilabel> &mdash; CDDB stands for CD 
      Database and is a huge global database of CD information. Each CD has an
      identity, which the CD Player can read. If you are connected to the 
      internet, it will then search a CDDB server for that CD identity and
      return any information it has on it. This usually includes CD Title,
      Artist, and track titles. It can also include notes and lyric 
      information. Once this data is retrieved, the 
      <application>GNOME CD Player</application> will store the information on
      your hard drive for future access. In the 
      <guilabel>CDDB Setting</guilabel> tab you can change the CDDB server 
      and edit your local CDDB database. You can read more about CDDB by 
      visiting the
      <ulink url="http://www.freedb.org" type="http"> FreeDB website</ulink>
      or the 
      <ulink url="http://www.cddb.com" type="http"> CDDB Website</ulink>.

   <para>
    Another feature in the <application>GNOME CD Player</application> 
    is the Track Editor. The track editor can be launched by the 
    <guibutton>Track Editor</guibutton> button on the main 
    <application>GNOME CD Player</application> window. The
    Track Editor allows you to edit the CD track information in case
    it is incorrect or there was no CDDB entry for your CD. You may
    also check the status of the CDDB information by pressing the
    <guibutton>CDDB Status</guibutton> button at the bottom of the
    Track Editor. This will show you what messages,  if any,  were
    returned from the CDDB server. The <guibutton>Submit</guibutton> 
    button is to sumbit information about the CD to the CDDB, if you
    are the lucky one to be the first to have a CD without any
    information at the CDDB site.
