GNOME Sound record (grecord) is a simple program for recording
and playing sound files.
You can start it by either typing 'grecord' at the command line
or selecting GNOME menu->Multimedia->Soundrecorder if you're
running GNOME.

It's goal isn't to be a super ultra wav editor, just to
be able to play and record, and later, be able
to do some basic "effects".

If you have any questions, ideas, bugreports, please please send
