GMIX 3.0
--------

If you are running an ES1370 card, please select the CD channel as a record
source to fix CD sound, and see ../BUGS for a more detailed explanation.

This is a XMIX replacement that uses GTK+/GNOME to create a user-interface.
It uses the /dev/mixer* devices from the Linux OSS sound-driver.

P.S.: The configuration has changed. Kill your old ~/.gnome/gmix file.
