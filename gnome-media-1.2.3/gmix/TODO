- rewrite docs in SGML
- add icons for devices
- configurable devicenames
- add support for sun's /dev/audio style devices. It's easy, just has to be
  done. We have some UltraSparcs at the University, and their audio-applets
  SUCK. Maybe if I can get the admins to install GNOME...
- store window position/size
  * I, Jason Leach, just added the ability to store window size, but don't
    think storing window position is really a good idea.  This is a task
    that is typically carried out by the window manager.  Having the
    program decide where it goes isn't going to be as good as the
    window managers best/first fit functions.
