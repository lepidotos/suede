1999-09-22  Tim Gerla  <timg@means.net>

        * cddb*.c: Patch from Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org> to allow
          proxy authentication.

1999-05-11  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* main.c (main): set the default cddb host to freedb.freedb.org.

1999-04-30  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* cddb-submit-methods: shortened the descriptions a little.

	* cddbsubmit.c: Added copyright notice.

1999-04-29  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* cddbsubmit.c: for email submissions, run the value of the constant
	MAIL_TRANSFER_AGENT, rather than /usr/sbin/sendmail.  That constant
	is set by some autoconf macros, so it should be more portable.
	Now cddbsubmit can submit using both email and http submit methods.
	(well it works on my system at least).

1999-04-29  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* cddbsubmit.c: new program that is responsible for submitting
	records to the cddb database.

	* cddb-submit-methods: new file.  Contains the methods that can be
	used to submit data to various cddb like databases.

	* Makefile.am: install cddb-submit-methods in $(datadir)/gnome.  Also
	build and install the cddbsubmit program.
	(cddbslave_LDADD): don't link against gnomeui libraries -- this is a
	non graphical program.

1999-04-17  James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>

	* main.c: added code to do lookups via cddb over http protocol.  It
	also allows use of http proxies for people behind firewalls.

	* Makefile.am (cddbslave_LDADD): link against GHTTP_LIB (empty if
	libghttp not found).

1998-12-22  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* main.c: SIGUSR2 not 1.

1998-12-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* main.c (set_status): Do not use files on /tmp, these are
	exploitable. 

1998-12-16  Tim Gerla  <timg@means.net>

	* No more hardcoded /tmp dir. Use glib stuff instead.

Fri Nov 27 20:38:47 CST 1998  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>
	* main.c: Changed cddb.cddb.com to us.cddb.com..need a capplet.

1998-08-31  Tim P. Gerla  <timg@means.net>
