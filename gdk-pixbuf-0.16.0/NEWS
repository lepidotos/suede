Version 0.16.0 "Deadly Yellow Snow"
-----------------------------------

* Merged fixes in GTK+ 2.0 to the pixops directory.  This should fix
  some memory overruns in the scaling/compositing code (Merge by
  Federico; fixes by Owen Taylor, Michael Hore, Sven Neumann, 
  Darin Adler).

* Merged the endianness conversion fixes from the GDK version into the
  Xlib version; oops (Federico).

* Minor documentation improvements (Federico).

Version 0.15 (Ben Bitdiddle Got Confused)
-----------------------------------------

* Fixed endianness conversion in the 16-bit gdk-pixbuf-drawable
  functions (Federico).

* Minor fixes for the IBM/AIX compiler (Christian Schaller).

* The image loaders are now linked against the pixbuf and GTK+
  libraries so that the Python bindings work (Johan Dahlin).

Version 0.14 "Camembert" (2001/12/13)
--------------------------------

* Backported the BMP loader from GTK+ 1.3 (Federico).

* Added support for BI_BITFIELDS coding to the BMP loader [Ximian bug
  #12125] (Federico).

Version 0.13 "Roquefort" (2001/10/25)
-------------------------------------

* Fixed stupid bug in the ICO loader.  ICO pixbufs should always have
  an alpha channel [Ximian bug #11224].  (Federico)

* Slight tweaks to the documentation Makefile.  (Federico)

Version 0.12 "Wensleydale"
--------------------------

* Added support for 16-bpp BMPs and ICOs (Federico).

* Added support for 32-bpp ICOs (Federico).

* Use the correct visual and colormap for the pixbuf-demo widgets (Jan Böhm).

* Install the headers in a versioned directory so that they don't
  collide with the GNOME 2 platform (Havoc).

Version 0.11 "Infrequent as a Moon of Green Cheese"
---------------------------------------------------

* Made the GdkPixbufLoader headers usable by C++ compilers by
  replacing "private" with "priv" (Dom Lachowicz, Diego González).

* Replaced the documentation Makefile with one similar to that in GTK+
  HEAD (Federico, but Owen deserves all the credit).

Version 0.10.1 "Dance the ghost with me but don't step on my toes"
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed thinko in color parsing routines (John).

Version 0.10.0 "Dance the ghost with me"
----------------------------------------

* New XBM file loader (John).

* We now have our own poor man's implementation of XParseColor() so
  that the XPM loader can work for both GdK and Xlib (John).

* Completely re-written PNM loader (Jeff, Pavel, Frédéric).

* Memory leak fixes for the PNG loader (Iain).

* Fixes to gdk-pixbuf.m4 (Mathieu).

* Updates for the new gdk_image_get() API return value (Ramiro).

* Offset computation fixes for the compositing functions (Larry,
  Mitsuru, Helmethead, Federico).

* Compositing fixes for greater accuracy (Federico).

* Fixed the GDK_PIXBUF_LIBS output so that image libraries are not
  linked with programs that use gdk-pixbuf (Miguel).

Version 0.9.0
-------------

* Integrated John Harper's patch to provide an Xlib-only version of
  gdk-pixbuf.  Now plain Xlib apps such as Sawfish can use gdk-pixbuf
  (John Harper, Federico).

* Animation bounding box fixes (Larry).

* Important error-handling fixes to the JPEG and PNG loaders (Michael,
  Larry).

* Miscellaneous build fixes (Darin, Frank, Mathieu).

* New flashy demo program of the scaling and compositing functions
  (Federico).

* New appendix in the programmer's documentation describing how to
  port applications from Imlib to gdk-pixbuf (Federico).

Version 0.8.0
-------------

* Fixed offsetting in scaling functions (Owen).

* Fixed compositing and bit-mangling bugs (Darin).

* Many build and configuration-related fixes (James, Tomasz, Karl).

Version 0.7.0
-------------

* The gdk-pixbuf library no longer requires Libart.  So we have some
  new types, such as GdkColorspace and GdkInterpType for (currently
  only) RGB colorspaces and all the interpolation modes for the
  scaling functions, respectively (Havoc).

* All structures that had public fields have been made opaque.  You
  will have to use the provided accessor functions instead (Havoc,
  Federico).

* The reference counting mechanism has been expanded so that you can
  hook to the last unref operation.  This means that instead of
  unconditionally finalizing the pixbuf, you can do something else.
  This lets applications implement a pixbuf cache in a nice fashion,
  as the rest of the application can use gdk_pixbuf_unref() as usual
  and everything will happen magically in the last unref handler (Tim,
  Darin, Federico).

* gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data() now takes a bits_per_sample
  argument, which must be 8 (Federico).

* Due to these changes, I decided to increase the libtool
  version number so that old compiled applications will keep
  using the old libraries instead of crashing with the new
  ones.  The loaders were renamed as well (Federico).

* gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask() will set the mask to
  NULL if the pixbuf does not have an alpha channel, instead
  of creating a solid mask rectangle (Federico).

* Fixed a bug where the `frame' argument of the
  GdkPixbufLoader::frame_done signal was not being specified in the
  call to gtk_signal_new() (Federico).

* The functions in gdk-pixbuf-scale.c now have some
  preconditions and sanity checks (Federico).

* The gdk_pixbuf_*_simple() functions now fail gracefully if
  they cannot allocate enough memory for the new pixbuf
  (Federico).


Version 0.6
-----------

* The gdk-pixbuf library can now be built as a single static library
  by passing the "--disable-modules" option to the configure script;
  all the image format modules will be linked in (Miguel).

* The progressive GIF loader should load multi-frame files correctly
  now (Michael).

* The GIF loader now handles an initial transparent colormap entry
  correctly (Jonathan).

* The XPM loader now handles the "g" color type correctly (Mark).

* Fixes for the scaling functions (Owen, Peter).

* Constification patches for pixbuf and image data arguments (Michael,
  Elliot).

* New sanity checks for the rendering functions (Ettore, Federico).

* Minor fixes to the testpixbuf-drawable program (David, Federico).

* Added an appendix to the documentation describing the configure
  options specific to the gdk-pixbuf module (Federico).

* Misc. documentation fixes (Alexander, Federico).

* Misc. installation fixes (Mark, Alan, Telsa, Havoc, Federico).


Version 0.5
-----------

* Support for GIF animations has been added.  We can even load
  animations progressively.  Thanks a lot to Jonathan for writing
  this; send a beer to this dude.

* We now have some obscenely fast functions to do scaling with
  interpolation and composition of pixbufs.  On ix86 machines these
  functions will use MMX if it is available.  Owen deserves a beer as
  well for writing this.

* New functions to convert Gdk drawable information to RGB format for
  pixbufs (Michael, Cody).

* New BMP image loader for Windows bitmaps (Arjan).

* New ICO image loader for Windows icons and cursors (Arjan, who
  deserves a beer as well for his excellent work on the loaders).

* New PNM image loader (DrMike).

* New utility functions for adding an alpha channel to a pixbuf and
  for extracting regions from pixbufs (Cody).

* API fixes, correctness fixes, and performance enhancements for the
  GnomeCanvasPixbuf item (Larry, Federico).

* Lots of fixes to the image loaders (Jonathan, Havoc, Arjan, DrMike,
  Mark, Federico).

* Installation, versioning, and library separation enhancements
  (Elliot).

* Miscellaneous build fixes and include file fixes (Raja, Havoc,
  Jacob, Federico).

* Compilation of gdk-pixbuf now produces two libraries, libgdk-pixbuf
  and libgnomecanvaspixbuf.  The latter contains only the
  GnomeCanvasPixbuf item; it was made separate so that the brave
  hackers who work on the HEAD branch of gnome-libs will not have
  symbol clashes.  People who use the pixbuf canvas item in their
  programs now have to pass an extra "gnomecanvaspixbuf" argument to
  the "--libs" or "--includes" flags of the gnome-config program.


Version 0.4
-----------

* Progressive loading support via GdkPixbufLoader.

* Completely new PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNM, XPM, and RAS loaders.

* New GnomeCanvasPixbuf item for the GNOME canvas.

* New convenience functions to render pixbufs to drawables.

* Integrated gtk-doc framework; reference docs are almost finished.


Version 0.3
-----------

* Added a libtool version number to the library.

* Changed the API function names to something more consistent.

* Removed the saving interfaces, since it is very hard to support the
  saving idiosyncrasies of every file format.

* Correctness and robustness fixes for the loaders.

* Fixed memory management with respect to user-supplied buffers.  Now
  the user has to supply a libart destroy notification function for
  when a pixbuf's reference count drops to zero.

* Added inline documentation comments for exported functions.  The
  DocBook documentation framework is still missing.


Version 0.2
-----------

* Upgraded libtool version.


Version 0.1
-----------

* First public development release.
