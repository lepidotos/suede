The gdk-pixbuf library provides a number of features:

	- GdkPixbuf structure for representing images.
	- Image loading facilities, both synchronous and progressive.
	- Rendering of a GdkPixbuf into various formats:
	  drawables (windows, pixmaps), GdkRGB buffers.
	- Fast scaling and compositing of pixbufs.
	- Simple animation loading (ie. animated gifs).

In addition, this module also provides a little libgnomecanvaspixbuf
library, which contains a GNOME Canvas item to display pixbufs with
full affine transformations.

Also, John Harper maintains the Xlib port of gdk-pixbuf.  This
included library lets you use the gdk-pixbuf rendering functions on
plain Xlib programs that do not use Gdk.
