* The loaders don't deal with exhausted memory conditions very
  gracefully.  For example, around io-jpeg.c:466:

	context->pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new(GDK_COLORSPACE_RGB, 
					 FALSE,
					 8, 
					 cinfo->image_width,
					 cinfo->image_height);

	if (context->pixbuf == NULL) {
		/* Failed to allocate memory */
		g_error ("Couldn't allocate gdkpixbuf");
	}

  This should *not* abort the program, but return an error condition
  to the loader instead.

  We do not have very good error reporting overall in the loading
  functions, either the synchronous file loaders or the progressive
  loaders.  We should figure out some common errors (out of memory,
  file not found, corrupted data, incomplete data, etc.) and add
  return values for them.  Yes, this means yet another API change.
  Live with it.

* The pixops functions could use better sanity checks.

* We could use some functions for doing full affine transformations,
  without using libart.

* gnome-canvas-pixbuf needs to be optimized.

* We need a good stress-test suite!!!  Some nongraphical regression
  tests for `make check' would be nice.

* We need complete programmer's documentation.
