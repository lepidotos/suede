This module holds sound files for a default GNOME set. Stick them in the
'sounds' directory here, or a subdirectory thereof - the whole tree will be
copied over into $(gnome_prefix)/share/sounds.

Please remember to add these sound files with the '-kb' option (to tell
CVS to treat them as binary files rather than text files).

The criteria for sound inclusion:
. No licensing issues
. Appropriate length
	. Shorter than 1 second for any sound that denotes a specific event
	. Shorter than 5 seconds for a background sound (basically, 
	startup/shutdown)
. Appropriate sound
	. Volume
		. Normalized between samples
		. 
	. Spectral range
		. No extremes
	. Good taste
		. KISS
		. General common sense (hah!)
