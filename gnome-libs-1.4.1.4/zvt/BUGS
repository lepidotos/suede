Current known bugs.

 - Lots of little ones.

 - Selection rendering.
    Sometimes the selection rendering gets out of sync with what
    is on screen - result is a mess.  Clear the screen to fix it up.

    Also, if a selection is setup, and the window exposed, it is
    redrawn in a different way (as reverse text, rather than XOR rendered
    over the top of pre-drawn text).  This will screw up if another
    selection is made without new output first.

    If you draw a window near edge (left or right) the screen, and the
    window manager has 'opaque move' enabled, refreshing of newly
    exposed lines can corrupt near the edges.

 - Terminal emulation.
    Although all the code to handle colour and most VT terminal
    attributes (e.g. Italic, Bold, etc) is in the terminal emulator,
    it is not all in the renderer.  i.e. You can't see any of it.

    A whole bunch of terminal emulation is not implemented - where
    do you get docs on this stuff? (Most of what has been written
    was reverse engineered from a Termcap entry).

    Application cursor keys dont work.

    Only does English as well.  Hopefully 16 bit characters aren't
    that hard to implement (internally there is room for it in each
    line, but currently its stripped to byte size first).
