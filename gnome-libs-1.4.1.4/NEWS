gnome-libs-1.0.6
----------------

Hello,

* New in this release:

	* Gnome Config:

	    James Henstridge added a new improvement for your sysadmin
	    pleasure: 

	    Now you can configure system globals by putting the
	    default values for a configuration file in the directory:
	    
		$sysconfigdir/gnome/config/

	    You can force a specific value for any configuration
	    setting in the directory:

	        $sysconfigdir/gnome/config-override/

	    This will allow system administrators to set system-wide
	    pre-defined defaults for the system

	* Dentry loader

	    Owen Taylor added support for the desktop-entry loader to
	    load KDE .kdelnk and launch KDE .kdelnk files.

	    This will be used extensively by the next gnome-core
	    release (scheduled for tomorrow, so you have plenty of time to 
	    compile this version :-).

	* Documentation

	    Our scheduled updates to the API documentation.  

	* ORBit changes

	    You need to use version 0.4.3.  Elliot Lee fixed our
	    problems. 

	* Zvt terminal emulator

	    Michael Zucchi upgraded the terminal emulator:

	    Should be fully xterm compliant.  People have complained
	    about problems on the emulation (these were produced
	    because the "xterm" definition was recently upgraded by
	    the XFree people to reflect the new features in xterm, and
	    we were not implementing them all).

	    Glibc 2.1.xx support.

	    
	* Bug fixes

	    A long list of bugs have been fixed by: Owen Taylor,
	    Asbjorn Pettersen, James Henstridge, Nuno Ferreira, George
	    Lebl, Timur Bakeyev, Michael Zucchi, Federico
	    Mena and Matthijs Melchior


======================================================================
gnome-libs-1.0.5
----------------

Hello, lovers of exotic primates,

The GNOME team has just released version 1.0.5 of the gnome-libs
module.  This is mainly a bugfix release.

* Availability:

    ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/latest/gnome-libs-1.0.5.tar.gz

* New features:

	- For developers only:  now you can run configure with
          --disable-gtk-doc, and then gnome-libs will not try to build
	  the HTML documentation from the SGML sources.  This is of no
	  concern to users, since the pre-packaged HTML files will be
	  installed correctly (Martin Baulig).

* Fixes:

	- Fixed stale references to the GNOME name server (Miguel de
          Icaza).

	- #include fixes in the .idl files (Elliot Lee).

	- Gnome-config and gnome-scores fixes (George Lebl).

	- Const-correctness fixes for gnome-fileconvert (Miguel de
          Icaza).

	- Canvas event propagation and item destruction fixes
          (Federico Mena).

	- Accelerator/menu fixes (Tim Janik).

	- Fixed ordering of some operations in gnome-client (Felix
          Bellaby).

	- Sanity checks for random parts of the libgnomeui code
          (George Lebl and Pavel Machek).

	- Correctness and permissions fixes in gnome-pty-helper (Erik
          Troan).

Please note that you may want to upgrade to Gtk+-1.2.1, since it has
some menu accelerator fixes as well.  You will get a big loud warning
if you don't upgrade :-)

Enjoy,

  Federico

======================================================================
gnome-libs-1.0.4
----------------

Hello, lovers of bugfix releases

The GNOME team has just released version 1.0.4 of the gnome-libs
package.

* Availability:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/latest/gnome-libs-1.0.4.tar.gz

* Major new features:

	- gnome-moz-remote: Now makes sure it uses a local copy of
          Mozilla for local URLs (i.e. "file:" ones).  Now uses GNOME
          WM hints if available to look for client windows (James
          Henstridge).

	- Users should now be able to properly customize their menu
          accelerators on the fly, and they should be saved correctly
          upon termination of the topmost gtk_main() loop (Tim Janik).

	- Zvt now supports selection when scrolling (Michael Zucchi).

* Minor fixes:

	- Making of documentation files now works for srcdir !=
          builddir (Raja Harinath).

	- gnome-moz-remote no longer depends on -lXmu or -lXt (James
          Henstridge).

	- Canvas item bounding and icon list button event fixes
          (Richard Hult).

	- Dialogs in gnome-dialog-util now get the correct focus
          (Federico Mena).

	- Timeout removal fixes in gnome-icon-list and
          gnome-pixmap-entry (George Lebl).


Have fun,

  Federico

----------------

Hello shared library lovers,

   Gnome libs 1.0.3 is now available for download.

   The site is the same:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-libs

* Major features:

	* API documentation.


	  The major thing on this release is that we now include the
	  API documentation for libgnome and libgnomeui in HTML format
	  (the SGML sources are provided if you want to generate
	  printable material.  you will need Docbook to generate the
	  postscript though).

* Minor fixes:

	* gnome.mime updated.
	  
	* GtkXmHTML should not produce run-time warnings.

	* GNOME Object IDL file.

	* Autoreload of MIME keys and MIME info if files are
	  modified. 

	* Icon Item redraw fixes (this will make your selected icons
	  on the desktop nicely selected, without the gray bounds).

	* Gnome Canvas fixes for affine-transformed items (Federico).

	* Gnome Message Boxes are nicer, better padding (Owen).

	* Gnome Docking repaint improvements (no more flicker, Federico).
	
	* Zvt widget supports wheel mice (Richard Hult)

	* Gnome-Pty-Helper will die at the proper times now.

Enjoy,
Miguel.

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-libs

What is new on this release:

* Improved gnome-bug script

* libgnome changes:

	- SIGPIPE reset to default value in gnome_exec, this does the
	  proper thing for various GNOME applications that start other
	  programs. 

	  People have been reporting problems with gzip, this fixes
	  it.

	- Raja improved the gnome_dirrelavtive_file routine.

* libgnomeui changes:

	- Documentation updates for the Canvas.  It should be fully 
	  API documented now (with the exceptions of the object
	  arguments, which needs to be done in a different framework)
	  (Federico).

	- IconList passes events for double and tripple clicks to
	  applications (George).

	- We now use mime-type routines for finding out image types
	  instead of the older method (George).

	- IconList should behave properly for people with
	  wheel-mouses. 

	- ColorPicker fixed for some corner conditions (Jaka).

* Zvt changes:

	- Shift-Insert will trigger a paste (for compatibility with
	  Xterm).
