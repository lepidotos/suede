2002-01-23  Wayne Schuller  <k_wayne@linuxpower.org>

	* colors.c: (my_get_colors), (set_widget_colors): Just some error 
	checking for NULL parameters. Helps to avoid 
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12493

2002-01-22  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	(k_wayne@linuxpower.org)
	
2002-01-06  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* *: Fix compiler warnings.

	of crashes. Fixes #60237, #61638, #63439, #65040, #66913 and more.
	* test.c: do not use %s for a boolean use %d instead.
	* parser: #if 0 out _ParserClearStack() since it's not used.

	* images.c: Fix a warning by initializing a var to NULL.
	
1999-08-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* gtk-xmhtml.h: Exclude this header #ifdef
	GNOME_EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED. We may still have an HTML widget
	in 2.0, but it will probably be different and people who
	want to be on the safe side and use only stable interfaces 
	should probably avoid it.

1999-06-01  Akira Higuchi <a-higuti@math.sci.hokudai.ac.jp>

	* gtk-xmhtml/XmHTMLP.h: Add three members lbearing, rbearing,
	and width. These members are computed in allocFont().
	
	* gtk-xmhtml/toolkit.h: Remove Toolkit_XFont() macro.
	
	* gtk-xmhtml/XmHTML.c:
	* gtk-xmhtml/fonts.c:
	* gtk-xmhtml/format.c:
	* gtk-xmhtml/gtk-xmhtml.c:
	* gtk-xmhtml/layout.c:
	* gtk-xmhtml/paint.c: Add fontset support. We use gdk_fontset_load()
	instead of gdk_font_load() iff a fontset is supplied for label
	widgets.
	
	* gtk-xmhtml/test.c: Add gtk_set_locale() call before gtk_init().

1999-05-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* images.c (imageDefaultProc): Use the colormap from the widget
	(before it was un-initialized).

1999-04-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* XmHTMLI.h: Always use full prototypes.  Fixes compilation on
	solaris-2.6 

Fri Apr  2 21:15:51 1999  ape@spacetec.no  (Asbjorn Pettersen)

	* parse.c (ParserWriteHTMLOutputToFile): 
	* test.c (main): Open file always in TEXT mode.

1999-03-12  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (gtk_xmhtml_size_request): Move to new
	styles of requisition, eliminate warnings.

1999-02-16  Ulrich Drepper  <drepper@cygnus.com>
	
	* gtk-xmhtml/debug.c (__rsd_selectDebugLevels): Use strtok_r instead
	of strtok.
	* gtk-xmhtml/fonts.c (initializeFontSizeLists): Likewise.
	(_XmHTMLLoadFontWithFace): Likewise.
	* gtk-xmhtml/map.c (getCoordinates): Likewise.

1999-02-21  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* Makefile.am (htmltest_LDADD): Use libgtkxmhtml.la  without the
	path from the topdir so that AM_MAKEFLAGS=-j4 works.

1999-0101  Raffaele Sena <raff@aromatic.com> via Russell Nelson <nelson@crynwr.com>

	* ARM gcc (and egcs) predefines arm to identify the processor. 
	Field renamed "rearm".

1998-12-01  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* XmHTMLfuncs.h: Avoid ordering problems by including stdlib.h and
	string.h.  #undef before #define to avoid warnings.

1998-11-28  Ronald de Man <deman@win.tue.nl>

	* XmHTML.c (_XmHTMLMoveToPos): Fix to the repaint.

Mon Nov 23 02:18:30 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gtk-forms.c: use gtk_scrolled_window_add_viewport for list box

1998-11-09  Jay Cox  <jaycox@earthlink.net>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c: remove reference to __FUNCTION__

Sat Sep 26 14:29:50 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am: don't install the test program

1998-09-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* readPNG.c (_XmHTMLReadPNG): I am the one to blame.  Fix PNG file
	loading.  I do not know how I ever commited this.

Thu Sep  3 05:56:45 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (gtk_xmhtml_forall): provide a _forall implementation
	instead of _foreach.

1998-05-11  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@fib.hl.no>

	* fonts.c (XmHTMLFontCacheInfo): Removed a compiler warning.

	* gtk-forms.c (XmHTMLStartForm): Removed a compiler warning.

1998-05-09  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@fib.hl.no>

	* XmHTML.c: Removed a compiler warning. Added declaration of 
	DestroyPhaseZero().

1998-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* readPNG.c (_XmHTMLReadPNG): Small fix to accomodate the newer
	PNG library requirement. 

	DrMike: this should fix the problem with PNG files.  Did any other
	format fail?

1998-04-23  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (pixel_color): Actually allocate the color,
	otherwise the pixel value will contain garbage.

1998-03-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtk-forms.c (_XmHTMLFormActivate): Do not free the values from
	the form on submit (as we are not the owner of the data, different
	from the Motif code).

	(_XmHTMLFormActivate): Cast the right widget in the FORM_TEXT.

Sun Mar 15 15:54:10 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* libgnome/Makefile.am libgnomeui/Makefile.am: 
	Added GTK_CFLAGS to INCLUDES

Wed Mar  4 00:43:58 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (gtk_xmhtml_class_init): Add the widget destroy
	code. 

Fri Feb 20 18:14:15 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* XmHTML.c (_XmHTMLMoveToPos): Implement missing Gtk functionality
	for updating the scrollbar position.

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (AdjustVerticalScrollValue): Implement Gtk version
	of this routine.

Thu Feb 19 13:49:32 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (gtk_xmhtml_foreach): Add container foreach method
	for the XmHTML widget.
	
	* gtk-xmhtml.c (gtk_xmhtml_init): Mark the gtk-xmhtml widget as
	not having a window.   Thanks to Federico for figuring this out.

1998-02-12  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* gtk-forms.c (_XmHTMLFormActivate): CHECK_CALLBACK returns int, 
	not pointer.

	* Makefile.am (htmltest_LDADD): Add $(INTLLIBS).

Wed Feb 11 20:27:19 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtk-forms.c (freeForm): gtk_destroy_widget is no longer needed
	with the refcounting changes. 
	
	* gtk-xmhtml.c (gtk_xmhtml_remove): Only god knows why I was
	adding the just removed widget.

Wed Feb 11 19:22:32 1998  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@adam.kaist.ac.kr>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (gtk_xmhtml_focus): Use gtk_signal_handler_pending
	instead of gtk_signal_get_handlers which doesn't exist anymore.
	* toolkit.h (CHECK_CALLBACK): Likewise.

	* XmHTML.c (TPROTO): Remove a comparison warning.

Tue Feb 10 18:02:19 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* XmHTMLP.h: Debugging fields on the structure are always
	included, no matter if DEBUG was defined or not.  Otherwise
	applications linked with XmHTML would required to use the same
	defines that were used originally. 

Mon Feb  9 16:49:00 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* toolkit.h (CHECK_CALLBACK), gtk-xmhtml.c: Get rid of the copy of
	the GtkHandler structure; the gtk_xmhtml_signal_get_handlers
	routine and use the exported routines and structures from the just
	modified Gtk.

Thu Jan 29 12:17:07 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (wrap_gdk_cc_get_pixels): Added wrapper function
	for gdk_color_context_get_pixels{_incremental}().  This function
	will first upscale the color information to 16 bits.  This
	function can be removed as described next.

	* XCC.c: I defined a USE_EIGHT_BIT_CHANNELS macro that makes the
	GetPixel functions expect color data to be in [0, 255].  Two
	macros, UPSCALE() and DOWNSCALE(), are used in those functions.
	When XmHTML is modified to use 16-bit color information, these
	macros and the #ifdef parts can be safely removed, as the
	functions already operate with 16-bit colors internally.

	* colors.c (XmHTMLAllocColor): Made this function use 16-bit
 	values for color matching.

	* toolkit.h (XCCGetPixelsIncremental): Removed un-needed do{}while(0)

	* XCC.c (XCCGetPixel): _red/_green/_blue parameters are now
	expected to be in [0, 65535].  This is to be friendlier to the Gdk
	port of the XCC.
	(XCCGetPixels): Made it use 16-bit color values as well.  Fixed
	mdist=1000000 buglet (it should start with at least 0x1000000).
	(XCCGetPixelsIncremental): Same as for XCCGetPixels().

1998-01-28  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* gtk-xmhtml.h (WITH_GTK): #define only #ifndef.  Prevent GCC
	warning.  

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Look in $(srcdir).

Mon Jan 19 12:56:08 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (gtk_xmhtml_realize): use
	gtk_widget_get_parent_window instead of widget->parent->window as
	posted by Owen.

	* Makefile.am (libgtkxmhtml_la_LIBADD): Add the Z_LIBS, JPEG_LIBS,
	PNG_LIBS and PNG_LIBS to the libgtkxmhtml_la_LIBADD, so that
	applications using this library do not need to autodetect which
	libraries this was linked with.

Wed Jan 14 19:28:01 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* colors.c (my_get_colors): Now we allocate the colors, just as
	Motif does.  I think they should be freed sometime, but they are
	not.  Lesstif does not free them, either.  I don't know if OSF
	Motif ever frees these colors...

Wed Jan 14 00:40:59 1998  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* toolkit.h (XCCFree): Allow for empty color contexts.

	* gtk-xmhtml.c: Massive changes to allow proper initialization of
	widget (basically, we now create the widgets that make up the HTML
	widget first instead of waiting for the source routine to be
	invoked).
	

Tue Jan 13 22:04:43 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gtk-xmhtml.c (gtk_xmhtml_new): The widget starts up frozen and
 	thaws itself when it is realized.  This fixes all of the problems
 	regarding realization, gc creation, and window background setting.

	* Lots of changes all over the place to fix colors.  Things are
	*almost* working right now.  I think I'm only missing setting the
	window backgrounds appropriately.  Several things were done:

		- Motif's color and gc fields from Core and XmManager were
		  replicated inside the GtkXmHTML widget structure.

		- Macros were created in toolkit.h to use these fields.

		- Instead of the old kludgy set_{fore,back}ground_internal
		  functions, we now set the window background directly.
		  This does not work perfectly; I'll look into it.

		- I created a shade_color() function in colors.c (ok, ok,
		  I stole it from gtkstyle.c) which mimics XmGetColors()
		  -- it calculates shaded colors for the 3D look.

	I hope to fix the remaining problems with window backgrounds real
	soon now.
	
Thu Jan  8 20:57:16 1998  Federico Mena  <federico@bananoid.nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* images.c (_XmHTMLFillXImage): Created a my_gtk_image_new()
	function that is just like the GDK_IMAGE_NORMAL part of the real
	gdk_image_new(), but it also supports specification of the padding
	and bytes_per_line parameters.  This fixes the non-working images
	on 16bpp.  Let's see later about images with less than 8bpp...

Wed Dec 24 12:05:31 1997  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* XmHTML-motif.c, XmHTML.c, XmHTMLP.h, callbacks.c, forms.c,
	frames.c, gtk-xmhtml.c gtk-xmhtml.h images.c, map.c, test.c,
	toolkit.c: More code sharing between the Motif frontend an the Gtk
	frontned;   More portability macros;  

	* The widget now emits signals for all of the events that are
	interesting (same as the Motif ones, but signalified). 

	* Lots of events are now handled, only missing are the keybaord
	events.
