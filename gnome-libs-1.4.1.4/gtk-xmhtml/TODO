- Test all of the change-property routines in Gtk/XmHTML.

- Get forms working (widgets).

- Figure out if the problem with documents without <BODY> is my fault.

	Ok, it seems it not a bug in the port, but Ripley's code 
	does not crash, he is testing somewhere that the <BODY> was
	missing (ie, the parser still has a bug, it is not inserting
	the BODY element).

- It is loading files relative to $PWD instead of the directory the
  page is.

- need_trakcing  not properly set in a couple of places (not harmful)

- Handle borders on frames

- Resizing is not working properly: for example, frames do not get resized
  when the main window is resized.
