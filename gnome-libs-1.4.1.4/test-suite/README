This is the beginnings of a test suite for the Gnome libraries.

Whenever you add a new, testable function to libgnome or libgnomeui,
please add a test program for it to test various features (i.e. make sure
it handles error conditions well, and does what is expected). The
tests/skel.c is something to start from.
