	with $the_test set to the name of the desired test.

	(noinst_PROGRAMS): List names of individual tests.
	(INCLUDES): Move here from Makefile.am.

	#define of the same name in `gnome-config.c'.
	(parse-path.cP): Include this file.  It contains the internal
	algorithm we desire to test.

	renamed from _test_suite_check_parse_path.
	(my_parse_path): Rename from `parse_path' to avoid conflict with
	`parse-path.cP'.

	* expected/metadata.out: Updated for new tests.
	* data/sample: New file.
	* tests/metadata.c (main): Set gnome_metadata_app_dir.  Added

	* tests/skel.c (main): `gnomelib_init' has one argument now.
	* tests/split.c (main): Likewise.
	* tests/fileconvert.c (main): Likewise.  Also, look for input file
	in $srcdir.
	* tests/trigs.c (main): Likewise.

	* runtest.sh: Cleanup.
	(LINK): Give the output of the LINK a name.

	Based partly on patch from James Michael Mastros

	machinery to build and execute the tests.  Should work for
