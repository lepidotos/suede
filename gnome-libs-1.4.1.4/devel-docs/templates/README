This directory contains useful DocBook templates you may want to use
if you are writing documentation for GNOME.  The purpose of having
these is that you can simply cut&paste useful markup bits into your
document without having to consult a DocBook manual very often.

The following templates are provided:

	annotated-source.sgml - Sample for including a piece of source
	  code with annotations.  Areas of the source are marked with
	  IDs and later referenced for explanation.  Use this if you
	  want to point out particular areas of interest in a piece of
	  source code.

	chapter.sgml - This is one of the most important templates,
	  and it defines the general form of a chapter.  The author
	  information section is especially important.

If you think you are using a particular piece of DocBook over and over
again, you may consider turning it into a template so that other
people can simply use it by cutting&pasting.  Please look at the
existing templates to see how to turn your piece of DocBook into a
nice template for other people to use as reference.

You can direct questions about these templates to the GNOME mailing
list <gnome-list@gnome.org> or to me, Federico Mena
<federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>.
