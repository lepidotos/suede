>      The X Window System is a big and complex hairball.  The Gnome
      libraries try to make things easy by wrapping the hard stuff with
      nice wrappers.  Still, there are a few things you should keep in
      mind in order to write better applications.
    </P
><P
>      This chapter is aimed at programmers with little experience on X
      programming.  If you do not know what graphics contexts,
      drawables, and visuals are, you should definitely read this
      chapter.  If you already know your way around the X way of doing
      things, you may skip this chapter and move on to the fun stuff
      (i.e. writing GNOME applications).
    </P
><P
>      Please note that this chapter is intended to be a small crash
      course on the X concepts you will need to keep in mind while
      writing Gnome applications.  It is not a replacement for an Xlib
      manual.  You should definitely get your hands on the Xlib
      programmer's and reference manuals.

>	Drawables are things which you can paint on.  X has two types of
	drawables, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>windows</I
> and
	<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pixmaps</I
>.  Pixmaps are off-screen entities
	which you cannot see.  You can see a window when it is mapped
	(shown) on the screen.
      </P
><P
>	Windows can be nested in a tree structure.  All windows except
	the root window have a single parent, but all windows may have
	any number of children.  Pixmaps cannot be nested and they don't
	have parents.
      </P
><P
>	Windows have x/y/width/height properties that define their
	position within their parent.  Pixmaps only have width and
	height properties.
      </P
><P
>	Windows and pixmaps have many other properties.  However, a very
	important property is the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>visual class</I
> of
	the drawable, which is what we will discuss next.
