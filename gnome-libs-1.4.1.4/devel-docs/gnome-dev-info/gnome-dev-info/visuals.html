>	Visuals are a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>very important</I
> concept that
	is often overlooked.  Roughly, a visual defines the memory
	representation that a piece of hardware uses to store the
	contents of an image.  X supports different kinds of visuals to
	suit the different kinds of hardware out there.
      </P
><P
>	There are three basic kinds of visuals, each divided into two
	classes:
      </P

></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Grayscale</I
> visuals are used for displays
	    that use a single channel of color information.  Black and
	    white or grayscale monitors (including amber and green
	    monitors) may use this type of visual.  These visuals can be
	    either <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>static gray</I
> or
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>grayscale</I
>.
	  </P
><P
>	    Static gray visuals are those in which you cannot change the
	    gray intensities of the hardware.  Plain monochrome (B/W)
	    displays or fixed 4-gray displays may be of the static gray
	    kind.  Grayscale visuals are those in which you can change
	    the gray intensities used by the hardware.  Exotic 12-bit
	    grayscale displays (as used for medical visualization) that
	    let you change the gray intensities may be of the grayscale
	    type.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Indexed</I
> visuals use the
	    "paint-by-number" concept:  each pixel value is an integer
	    that indexes a table of colors.  So 0 may represent black, 1
	    may represent pink, 2 may represent blue, etc.  These
	    visuals can be either <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>static color</I
> or
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pseudo color</I
>.
	  </P
><P
>	    Static color visuals are those in which you cannot change
	    the actual colors that the indexes correspond to.  Remember
	    the old CGA cards with four fixed colors in graphics mode?
	    These could be considered of the static color type.  Pseudo
	    color visuals are those in which you can change the actual
	    colors that the indexes correspond to.  Each index maps to
	    an RGB triplet that defines the color that will be displayed
	    on the screen.  You can change these RGB triplets for each
	    index.  Pseudo color visuals are very common in graphics
	    cards.  Graphics cards with 256 colors that you can change,
	    for example, VGA cards, are of the pseudo color type.

>	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Color</I
> visuals are the "big fat ones".
	    They usually provide the highest quality you can get from
	    the hardware, and they also consume the largest amount of
	    resources in terms of speed and memory.  Color visuals store
	    explicit RGB values for every pixel, instead of storing a
	    single value like indexed visuals.  Color visuals can be
	    either <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>true color</I
> or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>direct
	      color</I
>.
	  </P
><P
>	    The distinction between true color and direct color may be a
	    bit difficult to grasp at first.  After all, both visual
	    types use three values for every pixel.  What more could you
	    ask for?  The difference is that true color visuals use the
	    exact values you specified for a pixel as the color that
	    gets displayed on the screen for that pixel.  Most "true
	    color" SVGA cards are of this kind.
	  </P
><P
>	    However, the values in a direct color visual go through an
	    indirection step before being sent to the display.
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Each</I
> of the R/G/B values you specify is
	    an index in separate tables, and those tables contain a
	    translated value.  So an RGB triplet gets translated into an
	    R'G'B' triplet, i.e. the three tables together define an
	    f(r, g, b) -&#62; (r', g', b') function.  For most purposes,
	    your tables will be filled by the identity function and you
	    will get linearly increasing intensity values for each of
	    the RGB channels.  Things can become quite interesting,
	    however, when you modify the tables to have a nonlinear
	    mapping.  If you fill them using an exponential function,
	    you can do color correction on hardware, for example
	    (wheeee!).  Most high-end hardware (Sun/HP/SGI graphics
	    hardware) supports direct color visuals for high weirdness
	    and flexibility.

><P
>	These are the six visual classes supported by X (static gray,
	grayscale, static color, pseudo color, true color, direct
	color).  Why not deal directly with RGB triplets all the time,
	you may ask?  Indeed that would make programming easier.  The
	reason is that not all hardware thinks in terms of RGB triplets,
	and X acts close to the metal in this respect, so we are forced
	to deal with it.  Fortunately, this is not too hard to do.
      </P
><P
>	To remind yourself of what the different visual classes mean,
	think in terms of static gray, static color, and true color
	having read-only intensity mappings, and grayscale, pseudo
	color, and direct color having read/write mappings.
      </P
><P
>	In addition to the visual class, each visual has a bit depth.
	This is the number of significant bits that are used to encode
	the value of every pixel.  Most 256-color PC video cards operate
	on an 8-bit pseudocolor visual.  Better video cards operate on
	24-bit true color visuals, with eight bits of information per
	channel.  Some Amiga video cards operate on 12-bit pseudocolor
	visuals, which leads to a palette of 4096 indexed colors.  Some
	exotic hardware uses 8-bit truecolor visuals, using 3/3/2 bits
	for the RGB channels, respectively.
      </P
><P
>	The best way to know about the visual types your hardware
	supports is to run the xdpyinfo command.  You will get a load of
	interesting information.
      </P
><P
>	As we mentioned in the previous section, one of the properties
	of a drawable is its visual class.  This defines the image
	format that must be used to paint stuff on the drawable.
      </P
><P
>	Most low-end hardware supports a single visual class that is
	used for all the drawables.  For example, a SVGA card may run
	either in 8-bit pseudocolor or 24-bit truecolor; it is one or
	the other but not both at the same time.
      </P
><P
>	Higher-end hardware, however, may support different simultaneous
	visual types.  For example, many Sun and SGI video cards can
	handle 8-bit pseudocolor and 24-bit truecolor visuals
	simultaneously.  This means you can operate on windows with
	different visual types at the same time.  Go to an SGI box and
	run an xterm and run xwininfo on the xterm window; it will
	probably be using an 8-bit pseudocolor visual.  Now run xv or
	Electric Eyes, and you may see that it uses a 24-bit truecolor
	visual.  The hardware is smart enough to split its video memory
	in different areas for the pseudocolor and truecolor
	information, for example.
      </P
><P
>	The reason why it is convenient to have drawables with different
	visual types at the same time is performance.  For example,
	image information on pseudocolor visuals usually takes up much
	less space than that on truecolor visuals (a common example is 8
	bits per pixel versus 24 bits per pixel, respectively).  Using
	less memory also means that you can paint things faster, as
	there is less information to push around.  This is why most
	applications which are not graphics-intensive run in
	lower-quality visuals while programs that require high-quality
	images run on the fat visuals like truecolor and direct color.
      </P
><P
>	Having different simultaneous visual types also has subtler
	advantages.  Let us consider a piece of video hardware with
	enough memory to store pseudocolor and truecolor information for
	every pixel, plus one extra bit.  This bit is a flag that
	selects whether to paint the pixel from the pseudocolor or
	truecolor memory regions.  Say there is a hungry application
	with some windows on the truecolor visual that are slow to
	repaint (for example, a 3D rendering).  If the application needs
	to pop up a menu that will soon go away, it is convenient to
	create the menu on the pseudocolor visual, and set all the
	toggle bits on the corresponding region to indicate that it will
	use the pseudocolor visual instead of the truecolor one.  Since
	the information on the truecolor memory region is not erased,
	only not displayed, the X server can quickly un-pop the menu
	when it is done by simply switching the toggle bits back to the
	truecolor indication; there will be no need to request a repaint
	of that region to the application.  This means things will be as
	fast as possible.
