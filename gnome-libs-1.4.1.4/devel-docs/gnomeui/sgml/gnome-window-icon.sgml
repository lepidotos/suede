<title>Description</title>
<para>
  These functions are a convenience wrapper for the <link linkend="gdk-window-set-icon">gdk_window_set_icon</link>()
  function.  They allow setting a default icon, which is used by many
  top level windows in libgnomeui, such as GnomeApp and GnomeDialog
  windows.
</para>

<para>
  They also handle drawing the icon on the iconified window's icon in
  window managers such as TWM and Window Maker.
</para>

<para>
  These functions were added with the 1.2.0 release of the GNOME libraries
  in May, 2000.  This means that not all users will have this functionality
  in the GNOME libraries, and should only be used accordingly.  The header file
  must be explicitely included, also (include &lt;libgnomeui/gnome-window-icon.h>).
