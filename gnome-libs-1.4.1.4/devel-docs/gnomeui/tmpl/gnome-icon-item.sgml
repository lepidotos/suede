<!-- ##### SIGNAL GnomeIconTextItem::text-changed ##### -->
  <para>
    This signal is emitted when the user has finished editing the text
    in an icon text item.  Typically this happens when the user
    presses <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  The application has to decide
    whether the entered text is valid or not; for example, a file
    manager may want to test whether it is legal to rename a file to
    the proposed name or not.
  </para>

  <para>
    Upon receiving this signal, the application should use
    <function>gnome_icon_text_item_get_text()</function> to get the
    text for validation.  The return value of this signal indicates
    whether the proposed text is accepted by the application.  If the
    proposed text is valid, then a signal handler should return
    <symbol>TRUE</symbol>, otherwise it should return
    <symbol>FALSE</symbol>.  If the change is not accepted, the text
    is automatically reset to its original state.
  </para>

@icontextitem: Icon text item which emitted the signal.
@Returns: %TRUE if the change is accepted, %FALSE otherwise.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL GnomeIconTextItem::height-changed ##### -->
  <para>
    This signal is emitted when the height of an icon text item
    changes, usually due to the user changing the text or the
    application selecting a different font.  Applications can change
    their layout accordingly.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL GnomeIconTextItem::editing-started ##### -->
  <para>
    This signal is emitted when the user begins editing the text in an
    icon text item, usually by clicking on it while it is selected.
    Applications can use this information to disable drag and drop
    signals and update their state accordingly.
  </para>

@icontextitem: Icon text item which emitted the signal.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL GnomeIconTextItem::editing-stopped ##### -->
  <para>
    This signal is emitted when the user terminates editing the text
    in an icon text item, usually by pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap>
    or <keycap>Esc</keycap>.  Applications can use this information to
    enable drag and drop signals and update their state accordingly.
