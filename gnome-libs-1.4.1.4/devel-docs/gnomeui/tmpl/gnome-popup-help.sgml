gnome-popup-help

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
  A popup-help system for GtkWidgets.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
  This will add a popup-menu to a non GTK_WIDGET_NO_WINDOW() widget.  It
  also has the ability to add "cut", "copy" and "paste" to #GtkEditable
  widgets if needed.  It is important to not run this on a widget
  without a window, as doing so can lead to stuck pointer grabs.  This
  function should be used where possible everywhere else.

<!-- ##### MACRO gnome_widget_add_help ##### -->
<para>
This is the same as gnome_widget_add_help_with_uidata() but without the
options for the extra menu fields.
</para>

@widget: The widget to add the popup help to.
@help: The help message text.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gnome_widget_add_help_with_uidata ##### -->
<para>
This creates a popup menu on @widget with one entry.  The menu,
invoked by pressing button three on the widget, will have one entry entitled:
"Help with this."  Selecting this entry will bring up a tooltip with the help
variable as its text.  In addition, if the widget is a descendent of
#GtkEditable, it will add "cut", "copy", and "paste" to the menu.  If @help
is NULL, then it will <emphasis>just</emphasis> add the "cut", "copy", and
"paste".  Finally, if @menuinfo is non-NULL, it will append the menu defined
by it on the end of the popup menu, with @user_data passed to the callbacks.
This function currently only works on non GTK_WIDGET_NO_WINDOW () widgets
(ie. it only works on widgets with windows.)  If you would actually like a
handle to the popup menu, call gnome_popup_menu_get() as normal.
</para>

@widget: The widget to add the popup help to.
