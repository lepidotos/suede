	Indented the UI Guidelines prettily and fixed a couple of markup
	bloopers.

	* fundamentals.sgml: Added the "Levels of usage" section by
	as387@yfn.ysu.edu (what is this guy's name?).

	* components.sgml: New file.  This comes from the old
	ui-guide.txt file -- the UI Components section seems to have
	disappeared when it was converted to SGML.

	* ui-guide.sgml: Added the components.sgml file to the list of
	entities.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added the sgml files to EXTRA_DIST.

	* about.sgml: 
	* develinfo.sgml: 
	* fundamentals.sgml: Added the sgml variables at the end of the
	file to keep emacs happy.

	* ui-guide.sgml: Fixes to the authors and copyright.

1998-08-20  Martin Wahlen <mva@sbbs.se>

	* ui-guide.sgml: Broke it into documents by chapter, rather
	than a large on containing all the information.

	* ui-guide.sgml: New sgml version of the GNOME UI Guidelines,
	courtesy of Martin Wahlén (mwahlen@soundfound.com).

1998-08-07  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* ui-guide.txt: New file with the GNOME User Interface Guidelines.
	This is a work in progress.
