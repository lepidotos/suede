      X programming issues.  Relevant topics include how to write
      flicker-free widgets and widgets that resize correctly, how to make
      themable widgets by using the Gtk themes API, and how to extend the
      existing GNOME widgets.  It also has a checklist of things
      applications should have to conform with the GNOME User Interface
      Guidelines.]
