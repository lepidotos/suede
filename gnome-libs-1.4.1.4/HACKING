If you want to hack on the GNOME project, it will make your life easier
to have the following packages installed:

	- GNU m4 1.4
	- GNU texinfo 3.12 (for makeinfo 1.68)
	- GNU autoconf 2.13
	- GNU libtool 1.2d
	- GNU gettext 0.10.35
	- GNU automake 1.4
	- GNU guile 1.3a
	- GNU indent 1.91 (ORBit wants it)
	- GNU flex 2.5.4 (ORBit wants it)
	- GNU bison 1.27 (ORBit wants it)
	- SLIB 2c3 (See http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html)

These should be available by ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu or any of the
fine GNU mirrors.  Prerelease software can be found at alpha.gnu.org.

If you are accessing gnome via CVS, then you will have to run the
autogen.sh script with any possible arguments that you might want to
pass to configure.

    cvsroot/gnome# ./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gnome

If you like to build in a directory different from the source, you can
run `<path-to-src-dir>/autogen.sh' in the build directory.

Please submit patches to the gnome-list@gnome.org mailing list.  All
kinds of contributions are accepted. If at all possible, please use
CVS to get the latest development version of gnome; the README file
has the CVSROOT information.

				 FAQ

Q1. `aclocal' complains that there is no AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDE?

A1. You invoked `aclocal' without `-I macros'.  The `macros' subdir
contains other macros that are used for `gnome' configure.in files.
By omitting the `-I macros' you will not pick up those definitions.

The definition of AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDE is also in the `macros' subdir,
and this macro is named such that `aclocal' will complain if its
definition is not found.

If you use the `autogen.sh' script, all this is taken care of for you.

Q2. What is AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDE

A2. This macro ensures that aclocal is invoked with `-I macros'.

    - One way it does that is it sets the $(ACLOCAL) Makefile variable
    to included `-I macros'.

    - The other way is to cause Q1 ;-).
