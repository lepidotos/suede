>	Now, let's discuss the concept of directories. A
	<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>directory</I
> is a collection of files. It
	can be thought of as a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"folder"</SPAN
> that contains
	many different files. Directories are given names, with which
	they can be identified. Furthermore, directories are
	maintained in a tree-like structure; that is, directories may
	contain other directories. The top level directory is called
	the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root directory"</SPAN
> and denoted by
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>; it contains all the files in your
	system.

><P
>	  A <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pathname</I
> is a file's <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"full
	  name"</SPAN
>; it contains not only filename but also its
	  location. It is made up of the filename, preceded by the
	  name of the directory containing that file. This, in turn,
	  is preceded by the name of directory containing
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>that directory</I
>, and so on. A typical
	  pathname may look like
	  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home/sasha/talk.txt</TT
> which refers to
	  the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>talk.txt</TT
> in the directory
	  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sasha</TT
> which in turn is a subdirectory
	  in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
>.
	</P
><P
>	  As you can see, the directory and filename are separated by
	  a single slash (/). For this reason, filenames themselves
	  cannot contain the / character.  MS-DOS users will find this
	  convention familiar, although in the MS-DOS world the
	  backslash (\) is used instead. The directory that contains a
	  given subdirectory is known as the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>parent
	  directory</I
>. Here, the directory
	  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>home</TT
> is the parent of the directory
	  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sasha</TT
>.
	</P
><P
>	  Each user has a home directory, which is the directory set aside for
	  that user to store his or her files.  Usually, user home directories
	  are contained under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
>, and are named for the
	  user owning that directory, so that the home directory of user
	  <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>sasha</SPAN
> would be 
	  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home/sasha</TT

	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>papers/fieldtheory.txt</TT
>) with a character
	other than /, you're referring to the file in terms relative
	to your current working directory. This is known as a relative
	pathname.  On the other hand, if you begin a filename with a
	/, the system interprets this as a full pathname &#8212; that
	is, a pathname that includes the entire path to the file,
	starting from the root directory, /. Use of the full pathname
	is known as an <I
