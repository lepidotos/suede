><P
>      Every file on your system has an <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>owner</I
> &#8212; one
      of the users (usually the one who created this file), and a system of
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>permissions</I
>, which regulate access to this
      file.
    </P
><P
>      For ordinary files, there are 3 types of access permissions:
      read, write, and execute (the latter only makes sense for
      executable files). They can be set independently for 3
      categories of users: the file owner, the users in the group
      owning the file, and everyone else. Discussion of groups of
      users goes beyond the scope of this document; the other two
      categories are self-explanatory.  So, if the permissions on a file
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home/sasha/talk.txt</TT
> are set to read and
      write for user sasha, who is the file owner, and read only for
      everyone else, only sasha will be able to modify this file.
      
    </P
><P
>      All newly created files carry some standard permissions, usually
      read/write for user and read only for everyone else. You can
      view the permissions using the GNOME File Manager, by
      right-clicking on the file, choosing
      <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Properties</B
> in the pop-up menu, and
      then the <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Permissions</B
></TT
> tab. Using this
      dialog, you can also change the permissions &#8212; just click
      on a square representing the permission to toggle it.  Of
      course, only the file owner or the system administrator can
      change the permissions of a file. Advanced users can also change
      the default file permissions which are assigned to newly created
      files&#8212;see the manual pages for your default shell (usually
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>bash</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>csh</B
> or
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tcsh</B
>) and look for the command
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>umask</B
>.
    </P
><P
>      A file can also have some special permission properties such as
      UID, GID, and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"sticky"</SPAN
> bit. They are for advanced
      users only &#8212; do not change them unless you know what you
      are doing. (If you are curious: these permissions are typically
      used on executable files to allow the user to execute
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>some</I
> commands which read or modify files to
      which the user himself doesn't have access.)
    </P
><P
> Similar to files, the directories also have
      permissions. Again, there are 3 possible permissions: read,
      write, and execute. However, they have different meaning:
      namely, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"read"</SPAN
> permission for a directory means
      permission to list the contents of the directory or search for a
      file; <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"write"</SPAN
> means permission to create and remove
      files in the directory, and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"execute"</SPAN
> means
      permission to access files in the directory.
    </P
><P
>      Note that the permissions granted to a file depend on the
      permissions of the directory in which the file is located: in
      order to be able to read a file, a user needs to have the read
      permission for the file itself and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"execute"</SPAN
>
      permission for the directory that contains it. So, if user sasha
      doesn't want anybody else to see his files, he can achieve this
      by removing the execute permission on his home directory for all
      other users. This way, no one but himself (and, of course, root)
      will be able to read any of his files, no matter what the
      permissions of individual files are.
    </P

      for example, in the <A

TARGET="_top"

      page</A
> for the GNU <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>File Utilities</I

      package.
