>      In addition to regular files, UNIX also has special files called
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>symbolic links</I
> (or
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>symlinks</I
> for short). These files do not
      contain any data; instead, they are just
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"pointers"</SPAN
>, or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shortcuts"</SPAN
> to other
      files. For example, sasha can have a symlink named
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ft.txt</TT
> pointing to the file
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>papers/fieldtheory.txt</TT
>; this way, when a
      program tries to access the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ft.txt</TT
>,
      the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>papers/fieldtheory.txt</TT
> will be
      opened instead. As you can see from this example, the symlink
      and the target file can have different names and be located in
      different directories.
    </P
><P
> Note that deleting, moving, or renaming the symlink file
      has no effect on the target file: if sasha tries to delete the
      file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ft.txt</TT
>, it is the symlink that will
      be deleted, and the file
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>papers/fieldtheory.txt</TT
> will remain
      unchanged.  Also, the permissions of the symlink are
      meaningless: it is the permissions of the target file that
      determine whether a user has the access to it.
    </P
><P
> Symlinks can also point to directories.  For example, on
      the GNOME FTP server (<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ftp.gnome.org</SPAN
>),
      there is a file
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/pub/GNOME/stable/releases/october-gnome</TT
>,
      which is actually a  symlink to directory
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/pub/GNOME/stable/releases/gnome-1.0.53</TT
>
      &#8212; as one would expect, since <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"October GNOME"</SPAN
>
      is  just another name for 1.0.53 release
      of GNOME.
