>      UNIX is a modular system: it consists of many components so that
      a user (or system administrator) can choose those components he
      needs.  In particular, there are several layers of software
      responsible for graphical user interface. These layers are: X
      Window System, window managers, and desktop environment.
    </P
><P
> <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>X Window System</I
> (also known as X, or
      X11) is the component of UNIX systems responsible for virtually
      all basic graphics &#8212; in particular, for drawing icons,
      backgrounds, and windows in which your applications
      work. Without X, you only have command line. X11 sets the screen
      resolution and color depth, moves the mouse cursor around the
      screen, etc. It serves as a foundation for other components of
      graphical user interface such as window managers and desktop
      environments.
    </P
><P
> <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Window manager</I
> extends capabilities of
      X Window System by placing borders and buttons around windows,
      which allows the user to move, close, hide or resize the
      windows. X11 is virtually always used in combination with a
      window manager, since it would be pretty much unusable without
      one. There are many window managers available for X11; most
      popular are <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>fvwm</TT
>,
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>mwm</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>kwm</TT
>
      (used by KDE), <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Enlightenment</TT
>, and
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Sawfish</TT
>.
    </P
><P
> Finally, a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>desktop environment</I
> goes
      one more step further than a window manager by adding a
      graphical file manager from which you can drag-and-drop items on
      your desktop, a panel which can be used to launch frequently
      used applications, and a set of applications and utilities.
      There are several desktop environments available for all
      versions of UNIX; the most popular ones are <A

TARGET="_top"
>GNOME</A
>, <A
HREF="http://www.kde.org"
TARGET="_top"
>KDE</A
> and <A
HREF="http://www.sun.com/solaris/cde/"
TARGET="_top"
>CDE</A
> (soon to be
      replaced by GNOME).
    </P
><P
> Most desktop environments contain a window manager as their
      integral part; for example, KDE contains its own window manager,
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>kwm</TT
> (it is possible to use KDE with
      another window manager, but few people do so).  GNOME has no
      window manager of its own; it will allow you to choose any
      window manager you already have on your system. To make life
      easier for new users, usually the
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Sawfish</TT
> window manager is distributed
      with GNOME and is used by default; you can switch to
      another window manager using <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Control
      Center</TT
>. Note however that you will need a
      GNOME-compliant window manager to use such features of GNOME as 
      session management, taskbar applet, etc.
