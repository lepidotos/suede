      peripheral devices connected to your computer; this includes
      hard drives, floppy and CD-ROM drives, audio and video cards,
      serial and parallel ports, and much more. Each device has a
      name, such as <TT

>If the acronyms IDE and SCSI are new to you, here is a
      brief explanation: there are two types of interfaces for hard
      drives and other similar devices: IDE (and its cousins such as
      EIDE, ATAPI, etc.) and SCSI. SCSI provides better performance,
      but is more expensive, so it is only used on
      servers. If you are not sure what kind of drives you have, most
      probably it is IDE. </P

      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/cdrom</TT
> pointing to the actual device
      name corresponding to your floppy drive, modem, and CD-ROM drive
      respectively.
    </P
><P
>      You rarely need to use these device names. In particular, if you
      want to access a file on a drive, you do not use the device name
      (such as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/fd0</TT
>); instead, you first
      mount the device so that its contents shows as a subdirectory
      (for example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/floppy</TT
>) in the main
      directory tree, and then use this directory for accessing
      files; see <A
HREF="new-mount.html"
>the section called <I
>Mounting and unmounting drives</I
></A
> for more information. About
      the only time when you actually need to use the device names is
      when you are configuring some newly installed program. For
      example, a fax program can ask you for the device name for your
      modem (in which case you can either give it the actual device
      name, such as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/ttyS1</TT
>, or just use the
      symlink <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/modem</TT
>).
    </P
><P
> And just for fun: there is also a device
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/null</TT
> which acts as a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"black
    hole"</SPAN
>: you can send to it any information, and it never
    returns. So if you do not want to be bothered by error messages,
    re-direct them to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/null</TT
> -:).

><P
>	Note that it is possible to subdivide a hard drive (or a
	similar device) into parts which for all practical purposes
	behave as independent disks, even though physically they
	reside on the same disk. These parts are called
	<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"partitions"</SPAN
> (under Windows, the name
	<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"logical disk"</SPAN
> is used). For example, you can
	partition your hard drive into several partitions, and install
	different operating systems in different partitions; you can
	reformat each partition independently of the others. This
	partitioning of the hard drive is usually done during the
	installation of the operating system; refer to your
	installation guide for more information.
      </P
><P
> 
	If your hard drive has been partitioned then each partition
	is considered as a separate device. For example, if your hard
	drive is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda</TT
>, then the first
	partition on this drive would be referred to as
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda1</TT
>, the second as
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
>, and so on.

	  tools under Windows are partitioned in a strange way:

	  but this partition has number 4. Thus, if your ZIP drive is
