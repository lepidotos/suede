    <title>What is Gnome?</title>
    <para>    
      Gnome is a user-friendly graphical desktop environment for UNIX and
      UNIX-like systems that enables users to easily use and configure
      their computers.  Gnome includes a panel (for starting
      applications and displaying status), a desktop (where data and
      applications can be placed), a set of standard desktop tools and
      applications, and a set of conventions that make it easy for
      applications to cooperate and be consistent with each other.
      Users of other operating systems or environments should feel
      right at home using the powerful graphics-driven environment
      Gnome provides. Gnome runs on a number of UNIX-like operating
      systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. 
    </para>
   <para> Gnome is completely open source (free software) developed by
      hundreds of programmers around the world. Both the source code
      and ready-to-run binaries of Gnome are available for download on
      the Internet; they are distributed under the terms of <ulink
      type="gnome-help" url="gnome-help:gpl"> GNU General Public
      License</ulink> (and its cousins, <ulink type="gnome-help"
      url="gnome-help:lgpl">Lesser General Public License</ulink> and
      <ulink type="gnome-help" url="gnome-help:fdl">Free Documentation
      License</ulink> for libraries and documentation
      respectively). In particular, this means that everyone is free
      to use, copy or distribute Gnome. If you would like to learn
      more about the Gnome project please visit the <ulink
      url="http://www.gnome.org" type="http">Gnome web site</ulink>.
   </para>
   <para>
      Gnome is highly configurable, enabling you to set your desktop
      the way you want it to look and feel.  Gnome supports many human
      languages, and more are added every month.  Gnome even supports
      several Drag and Drop protocols for maximum interoperability
      with non-Gnome applications.
   </para>

   <para>
    Gnome comes from the acronym for the GNU Network Object Model
    Environment (GNOME).  Gnome is a part of the larger GNU project,
    started in 1984 to develop a completely free UNIX-like operating
    system.  For more information, visit the <ulink

    <title>About This Guide</title>
    <para>
      This guide gives you a short introduction to Gnome. It is not
      intended to cover all details of Gnome; if you need more
      information, you should read detailed manuals listed in <xref
      linkend="otherinfo">. Also, this guide assumes you already have
      Gnome installed; if you need help installing Gnome, please check
      the instructions on <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org"
      type="http">Gnome Website</ulink>.
    </para>
 
    <para> 
      This guide was written by the members of Gnome
      Documentation Project (GDP). If you have any comments or
      suggestions about this guide
      or if you can offer any other help in improving or translating
      Gnome documentation, please send an e-mail  to
      <email>docs@gnome.org</email>, or visit <ulink
      url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/" type="http">GDP Web
      Site</ulink>. 
    </para>
    <para> The authors of this guide assume that you are
      using the default configuration of Gnome (that is, default GTK
      theme and <application>sawfish</application> window manager with
      <guilabel>MicroGUI</guilabel> theme). Gnome is highly
      configurable, so it is easy to change not only the look but also
      the behavior of Gnome; however, we recommend that you do so only
      after you already have some experience with Gnome.
    </para>
  </sect1>
<!-- ==================Section: ======================== -->
<sect1 id="conventions">
    <title>Mouse Conventions Used in This Guide</title> 
    <para>
      Before  describing Gnome, let us introduce some terms used not 
      only in this guide but in all Gnome documents. Most importantly,
      we need to clarify the use of mouse buttons and clicks. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Most Gnome documents assume that you are using a standard (for
      UNIX) 3-button mouse and talk about left, right, and middle
      mouse buttons; if a document says <quote>click</quote> without
      explicitly specifying the button, the left button is
      assumed. Some documents use notations <quote>mouse button
      1</quote>, <quote>mouse button 2</quote> and <quote>mouse button
      3</quote> (or MB1, MB2, MB3 for short) for left, middle, and
      right buttons respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are using a two-button mouse, you can emulate the middle
      mouse button by pressing left and right buttons simultaneoulsy;
      if you have a wheel mouse, the wheel can be used in place of the
      middle mouse button.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can switch the roles of the buttons using Gnome <application>
      Control Center</application>. Many left-handers choose to reverse the
      right and left buttons. If you have done so, you need to use the 
      right mouse button whenever document instructs you to click, and use
      <emphasis>left</emphasis> mouse button whenever a document talks
      about <quote>right-clicking</quote> or mouse button 3.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you use a mouse with some unusual placement of buttons, a
      trackball, or some other input device, you need to find out
      which buttons correspond to <quote>right</quote>,
      <quote>left</quote> and <quote>middle</quote>; this information
      can usually be found in the manual which came with your
      device. Usually, <quote>left</quote> button (MB1) is the one
      under your index finger. 
    </para>

<!-- =======Subsection ============ -->
<sect2 id="panel">
      <title>Panel</title>
      <para>
	The long bar at the bottom of <xref linkend="desktop-fig"> is
	a Gnome Panel. It contains a number of useful things, such as 
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The <guibutton>Main 	Menu</guibutton>: this is the
	      button with the stylized footprint. Clicking this button
	      brings up a menu containing all Gnome applications
	      and commands, including the logout command. 
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem> 
	    <para>
	      Application launchers: these are buttons that start
	      various programs. For example,  the toolbox button
	      starts the <application>Gnome Control Center</application>
	      (for configuring your system).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Panel applets: these are are tiny programs designed to
	      work inside the Panel. For example, the
	      <application>clock</application> applet on the far right
	      shows the current time, and
	      <application>tasklist</application> applet (in the
	      middle of the panel) shows the list of all application
	      windows  on your desktop (this will be discussed in
	      detail in <xref linkend="tasklist">). 
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para> As with all Gnome components, Panel is highly
	configurable: you can add or remove application launchers and
	applets, edit the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>, change Panel
	background, or even create new Panels. For example, to move an
	object, drag it to the new location using the <link
	linkend="conventions">middle mouse button</link>; to configure
	an object, get help on it, or remove it from the Panel,
	right-click on it and select the appropriate item from the
	<guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu. To hide the Panel when you are
	not using it, click on one of the <guibutton>Hide
	buttons</guibutton> (with small arrows) at the ends of the
	Panel.
      </para>
      <para>More Panel operations are available from the
	<guimenu>Panel</guimenu> menu, which you can open by
	right-clicking in any empty space on the Panel (for example,
	in the hide arrows) and selecting <guisubmenu>Panel</guisubmenu>
        from the menu. The Panel menu also contains <ulink type="help"
	url="gnome-help:panel">Panel manual</ulink>, which describes
	all these options and more.  </para>
    </sect2>
<!-- =======Subsection ============ -->
    <sect2 id="desktop"> 
      <title>Desktop</title> 
      <para>
	Everything outside the Panel is called
	<quote>desktop</quote>. You can place icons for files, applications,
        and other items on the desktop (a default collection of icons is
        installed with Gnome), after which you can double-click on an item
        to use it:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
	<listitem>
	  <para>   
	    If the item is a program, that program will start.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    If it is a data file, the appropriate program will start
	    up with that data loaded.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>  

	  <para>
	    If it is a directory, the File Manager will start and show
	    the contents of that directory. Your desktop will probably
	    have a icon showing a house and labeled
	    <guilabel><replaceable>yourname</replaceable>'s
	    Home</guilabel>. Double-clicking on this icon will start
	    the File Manager at your home directory.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	The easiest way to place an item on the desktop is to
	drag-and-drop a file from the File Manager window. This will be
	discussed in more detail in <xref linkend="nautilus">. Once
	the item is placed on the desktop, you can move it around the
	desktop using the left mouse button, or you can click on it
	with the right mouse button to bring up the
	<guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu which allows you to delete the
	item or change its properties.
    </para>
    </sect2>

<!-- =======Subsection ============ -->
    <sect2 id="mouse"> 
      <title>Using the Mouse</title> 
      <para>    
	As you have already seen, you can do almost anything just by
	clicking with your mouse. Here are some conventions which work
	almost anywhere in Gnome:
      </para> 

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet"> 
	<listitem><para> 
	    Clicking on  an item with the left mouse button selects
	    (hilights) it. If you need to select several objects, hold down
	    <keycap>CTRL</keycap> key while clicking. 
	  </para></listitem>
	<listitem><para> 
	    Double-clicking on an item runs the default action for
	    this item (running an application, opening the file, etc.) 
	  </para></listitem> 
	<listitem><para> 
	    Clicking on an item with the right mouse button brings up
	    the context menu, which contains all the commands and
	    information available for this item. If you have selected
	    a group of items, right-clicking on any of them will bring
	    up the context menu which applies to all of these items.
	  </para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	    You can
	    select text anywhere on the screen using the left mouse
	    button, and then insert this text into any other place on
	    the screen which accepts text input, by clicking with the
	    <link linkend="conventions">middle mouse button</link>.
	  </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	In addition, clicking with the right mouse button on any empty
	space on your desktop brings up a <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu>
	menu, which allows you to change desktop background or other
	properties, or add a new item to the desktop. Clicking on the
	desktop with the middle mouse button produces the default menu
	for your window manager (see <xref linkend="windows">).
	</para> 
    </sect2> 

<!-- =======Subsection:Logging out ============ -->
    <sect2 id="logout"> 
      <title>Logging Out</title> 
      
      <para> To log out of Gnome, click on the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>
	button and select <guimenuitem>Log out</guimenuitem>. Gnome
	will prompt you for confirmation; it will also give you an
	option to save the session &mdash; that is, information about
	currently open applications and their location on the screen
	will be saved, so that when you login next time, the same
	applications will be in the same places (this only works for
	applications which are fully Gnome-compliant).

<sect1 id="windows">
    <title>Working With Windows</title>
    <para>
      The graphical system used by all UNIX-like operating systems, X
      Window System, allows you to have several windows on your
      screen, with a different application running each in each
      window. By itself, however, X Window System can only do very
      low-level operations, so it is always used in conjunction with
      another piece of software, called window manager. A window
      manager provides windows' borders and buttons, allows you to
      move, close, and resize windows, etc. Gnome can work with many
      window managers. The most popular are:
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.enlightenment.org">
      <application>Enlightenment</application></ulink> and <ulink
      type="http" url="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net">
      <application>Sawfish</application></ulink> (formerly known as
      Sawmill). Each window manager can use many different styles of
      window decorations and buttons (this is referred to as
      <quote>window manager theme</quote>). Since it is impossible to
      cover them all, in this section we only describe the default
      window manager shipped with Gnome, 
      <application>Sawfish</application>, and its default theme
      (<guilabel>MicroGUI</guilabel>). An example of  the window border in
      the <guilabel>MicroGUI</guilabel> theme is shown in <xref
      linkend="microguiborder">

	      To close a window, click on the button with the

	    <para>
	      To maximize a window, i.e. make it fill the entire
	      screen (except for the part taken by the panels), click
	      on the button with small yellow <quote>up</quote>
	      arrow. Clicking on this arrow once again will restore

	As most modern graphic file managers,

        properties or permissions, and more.

      <para> <application>Nautilus</application> also provides an easy
	way to move files between directories. To move move a file

      <para> <application>Nautilus</application> provides many more

      <title>Killing a Stalled Application</title>
      <para>
	If an application is stalled or frozen &mdash; that is, if it
	does not respond to your mouse clicks and keyboard commands,
	you can either wait and hope that it wakes up, or kill it. If
	you decide to kill it (NOTE: You will lose all unsaved data),
	start the <application>Gnome System monitor</application>
	(from <guisubmenu>System</guisubmenu> submenu of the
	<guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>), right-click on the frozen
	application name, and select <guimenuitem>Kill
	now</guimenuitem>. Using <application>Gnome System
	monitor</application> also allows you to find and kill all
	helper processes started by this application.
	</para>
      <para>
	If a Gnome application freezes or crashes (unexpectedly dies)
	repeatedly, you should file a bug report as described in <xref

      <para> If your whole system is frozen and is not responding, do not
      hurry to push the <quote>reset</quote> button on the computer
      &mdash; this is usually the worst solution. Most probably, it is
      not the operating system itself that is frozen (UNIX systems are
      known for stability), but just the graphical part, X Window
      System. In this case, you can try to restart X Window System by
      simultaneously pressing
 <!--      <keycombo>-->
    <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>ALT</keycap>-<keycap>Backspace</keycap>. 
 <!--   </keycombo>-->  This should work for
      the implementation of X Window system used on Linux and *BSD,
      XFree86 &mdash; unless it was disabled by your system
      administrator. Of course, in this way you also lose all unsaved
      data, but at least you do not risk to mess up the whole file
      system.

      <title>My Gnome Desktop Icons Are All Messed up!</title>

	This sometimes happens when upgrading from an older version of
	Gnome. In this case, try this trick: delete the file
	<filename>~/.Gnome/metadata.db</filename> (note the dot!), where
	<filename>~</filename> is your home directory, then log out and
	login again. If this didn't help, read on.

      <title>My Whole Gnome Configuration is Messed Up!</title>
      <para> 
	If you have more serious  problems than just desktop icons &mdash;
	for example, if your panel is missing &mdash; the radical solution
	is to remove all your Gnome configuration files and start from
	scratch. This is an emergency solution, as you lose all
	configuration settings and will need to configure your menus,
	panels, etc. again from scratch, that is, from the default Gnome
	configuration. However, this only affects Gnome configuration,
	so your data files and settings for non-Gnome applications
	remain intact. 
      </para>
      <para> To remove all your Gnome configuration files and return
	to the original Gnome configuration, logout then log in again
	holding down keys <keycap>CTRL</keycap> and
	<keycap>SHIFT</keycap> (immediately after entering your
	password in the login dialog). You will be presented a dialog,
	offering you the choice to reset the saved session (that is,
        which applications were open when you last logged out); reset
        your Gnome configuration settings; or both.  
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, if you have really severe problems and your system
	freezes or becomes otherwise unusable as soon as you login,
	you have one last option. You can  select
	<guimenuitem>Failsafe</guimenuitem> session type instead of
	the default <guimenuitem>Gnome</guimenuitem> in the login
	screen. Both Gnome and KDE Login Managers support this. In
	this session type, Gnome is not started; instead, you are
	presented with a single terminal window. This is almost
	guaranteed to start OK, and if you know how to use
	command-line tools to find and fix your problem, you have a
	chance. Otherwise, ask an expert.

	      This short document gives the minimal necessary
	      information about UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems,
	      including such things as filenames, paths and
	      directories, permissions, symbolic links and most
	      confusing of them all, the notion of
	      <quote>mounting</quote>. If you never used UNIX system
	      before, be sure to read this.

	In addition to documentation shipped with Gnome, there is also
	wealth of information available on the Internet. A good
	starting point is, of course, the <ulink type="http"
        url="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome Website</ulink>. There you
        will find instructions for installing Gnome, reviews and tips,
        developer information, and more.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you can not find an answer to your question there, you
	may ask other Gnome users and developers on Gnome mailing list
        (subscription instructions can be found <ulink type="http"
	url="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-list">here</ulink>).
	Note, however, that this list is for Gnome-related questions
        only (do not ask how to configure X Window System, for instance),
        and it is impolite (to say the least) to ask a question without
        first checking if this question is already answered in available
        documents such as <ulink type="gnome-help"
	url="gnome-help:users-faq">Gnome FAQ</ulink>.

	You should realize that Gnome is just part of your computer
	system. If you want to unleash the full potential of your
	computer, you need to understand not just Gnome but also the
	underlying operating system (UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD), various
	tools and utilities included with it, and its graphics system
	(X Window System). Each of these components usually comes with
	its own documentation. Most of UNIX commands and utilities are
        documented in so-called <quote>manual pages</quote>, or man pages
        for short. You can view them using <application>Nautilus</application>
        (see <xref linkend="nautilus-help">). This documentation is usually
        very detailed and more technical than most users would like.
        Another documentation format used by utilities from the
	GNU project is called <quote>info pages</quote>. They, too,
	can be viewed using <application>Nautilus</application>. Many
	applications also have documentation in other formats. Sometimes
        it is not easy to find documentation for a given application &mdash;
        try looking in the directory <filename>/usr/doc</filename>.
      </para>
      <para> Documentation for operating system itself varies from one
        system to another. The best advice is to check the printed manual
        which came with your system. For Linux, a good source of information
        is the Linux Documentation Project (LDP); you can read or their
        documentation on the Internet (at <ulink type="http"
	url="http://www.linuxdoc.org">http://www.linuxdoc.org</ulink>).
	Virtually all Linux distributions also include copies of LDP
	documents; usually they are found at
	<filename>/usr/doc/LDP</filename> or
	<filename>/usr/doc/HOWTO</filename>.
      </para>
      <para> 
	And of course, there are a number of books available about all
	flavors of UNIX/Linux, Gnome, and about anything else you might
        be interested in. Check your local bookstore.

      If you find a bug in one of Gnome applications, please report
      it!  The developers do read these reports and try to fix all
      reported bugs.  The easiest way to send a bug report is to use
      <application>Gnome Bug Report Tool</application>, found in the
      <guisubmenu>Utilities</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
      Menu</guimenu>. This tool will be automatically started if a
      Gnome application crashes. It should also be used for submitting
      suggestions or requests for new features for Gnome applications:
      just select <guilabel>Severity: enhancement</guilabel> in the
      appropriate window of <application>Gnome Bug Report
      Tool</application>.

      If you have questions  about Gnome, or want to discuss Gnome
      with other users and developers, you should subscribe to the 
      Gnome mailing list as described in <xref linkend="gnome-www">.
