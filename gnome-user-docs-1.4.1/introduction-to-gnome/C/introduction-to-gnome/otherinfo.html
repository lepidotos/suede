	In addition to documentation shipped with Gnome, there is also
	wealth of information available on the Internet. A good
	starting point is, of course, the <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Gnome Website</A
>. There you
        will find instructions for installing Gnome, reviews and tips,
        developer information, and more.
      </P
><P
>	If you can not find an answer to your question there, you
	may ask other Gnome users and developers on Gnome mailing list
        (subscription instructions can be found <A
HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-list"
TARGET="_top"
>here</A
>).
	Note, however, that this list is for Gnome-related questions
        only (do not ask how to configure X Window System, for instance),
        and it is impolite (to say the least) to ask a question without
        first checking if this question is already answered in available
        documents such as <A
HREF="gnome-help:users-faq"
TARGET="_top"
>Gnome FAQ</A
>.

>	You should realize that Gnome is just part of your computer
	system. If you want to unleash the full potential of your
	computer, you need to understand not just Gnome but also the
	underlying operating system (UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD), various
	tools and utilities included with it, and its graphics system
	(X Window System). Each of these components usually comes with
	its own documentation. Most of UNIX commands and utilities are
        documented in so-called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"manual pages"</SPAN
>, or man pages
        for short. You can view them using <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Nautilus</TT
>
        (see <A
HREF="nautilus.html#NAUTILUS-HELP"
>the section called <I
>Reading Documentation With Nautilus</I
></A
>). This documentation is usually
        very detailed and more technical than most users would like.
        Another documentation format used by utilities from the
	GNU project is called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"info pages"</SPAN
>. They, too,
	can be viewed using <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Nautilus</TT
>. Many
	applications also have documentation in other formats. Sometimes
        it is not easy to find documentation for a given application &#8212;
        try looking in the directory <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc</TT
>.
      </P
><P
> Documentation for operating system itself varies from one
        system to another. The best advice is to check the printed manual
        which came with your system. For Linux, a good source of information
        is the Linux Documentation Project (LDP); you can read or their
        documentation on the Internet (at <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxdoc.org</A
>).
	Virtually all Linux distributions also include copies of LDP
	documents; usually they are found at
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc/LDP</TT
> or
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc/HOWTO</TT
>.
      </P
><P
> 
	And of course, there are a number of books available about all
	flavors of UNIX/Linux, Gnome, and about anything else you might
        be interested in. Check your local bookstore.
