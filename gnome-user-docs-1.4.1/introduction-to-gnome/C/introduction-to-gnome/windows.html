>      The graphical system used by all UNIX-like operating systems, X
      Window System, allows you to have several windows on your
      screen, with a different application running each in each
      window. By itself, however, X Window System can only do very
      low-level operations, so it is always used in conjunction with
      another piece of software, called window manager. A window
      manager provides windows' borders and buttons, allows you to
      move, close, and resize windows, etc. Gnome can work with many
      window managers. The most popular are:
      <A
HREF="http://www.enlightenment.org"

>      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Enlightenment</TT
></A
> and <A
HREF="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net"
TARGET="_top"
>      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Sawfish</TT
></A
> (formerly known as
      Sawmill). Each window manager can use many different styles of
      window decorations and buttons (this is referred to as
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"window manager theme"</SPAN
>). Since it is impossible to
      cover them all, in this section we only describe the default
      window manager shipped with Gnome, 
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Sawfish</TT
>, and its default theme
      (<TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"

	      applications in other windows are idle &#8212; they can
	      be running as well.) To help you see which window has
	      focus, the title bar of this window has different color
	      (left side is blue, as opposed to gray for all other
	      windows). To change focus to another window, just click
