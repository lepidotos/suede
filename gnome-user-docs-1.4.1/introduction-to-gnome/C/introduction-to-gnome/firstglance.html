	a Gnome Panel. It contains a number of useful things, such as 
	<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Main 	Menu</B
>: this is the
	      button with the stylized footprint. Clicking this button
	      brings up a menu containing all Gnome applications
	      and commands, including the logout command. 
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	      Application launchers: these are buttons that start
	      various programs. For example,  the toolbox button
	      starts the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnome Control Center</TT
>
	      (for configuring your system).
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	      Panel applets: these are are tiny programs designed to
	      work inside the Panel. For example, the
	      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>clock</TT
> applet on the far right
	      shows the current time, and
	      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>tasklist</TT
> applet (in the
	      middle of the panel) shows the list of all application
	      windows  on your desktop (this will be discussed in
	      detail in <A
HREF="windows.html#TASKLIST"
>the section called <I
>Tasklist</I
></A
>). 
	    </P
></LI
></UL

      </P
><P
> As with all Gnome components, Panel is highly
	configurable: you can add or remove application launchers and
	applets, edit the <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Main Menu</B
>, change Panel
	background, or even create new Panels. For example, to move an
	object, drag it to the new location using the <A
HREF="conventions.html"
>middle mouse button</A
>; to configure
	an object, get help on it, or remove it from the Panel,
	right-click on it and select the appropriate item from the
	<B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>pop-up</B
> menu. To hide the Panel when you are
	not using it, click on one of the <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Hide
	buttons</B
> (with small arrows) at the ends of the
	Panel.
      </P
><P
>More Panel operations are available from the
	<B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Panel</B
> menu, which you can open by
	right-clicking in any empty space on the Panel (for example,
	in the hide arrows) and selecting <B
CLASS="GUISUBMENU"
>Panel</B
>
        from the menu. The Panel menu also contains <A
HREF="gnome-help:panel"
TARGET="_top"
>Panel manual</A
>, which describes
	all these options and more.  </P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="SECT2"

CLASS="SECT2"
><A
NAME="DESKTOP"
>Desktop</A
></H2
><P
>	Everything outside the Panel is called
	<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"desktop"</SPAN
>. You can place icons for files, applications,
        and other items on the desktop (a default collection of icons is
        installed with Gnome), after which you can double-click on an item
        to use it:
      </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>   
	    If the item is a program, that program will start.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>	    If it is a data file, the appropriate program will start
	    up with that data loaded.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>	    If it is a directory, the File Manager will start and show
	    the contents of that directory. Your desktop will probably
	    have a icon showing a house and labeled
	    <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>yourname</I
></TT
>'s
	    Home</B
></TT
>. Double-clicking on this icon will start
	    the File Manager at your home directory.
	  </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>	The easiest way to place an item on the desktop is to
	drag-and-drop a file from the File Manager window. This will be
	discussed in more detail in <A
HREF="nautilus.html"
>the section called <I
>Nautilus: Gnome File Manager, Help Browser, and More</I
></A
>. Once
	the item is placed on the desktop, you can move it around the
	desktop using the left mouse button, or you can click on it
	with the right mouse button to bring up the
	<B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>pop-up</B
> menu which allows you to delete the
	item or change its properties.

	As you have already seen, you can do almost anything just by
	clicking with your mouse. Here are some conventions which work
	almost anywhere in Gnome:
      </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
> 
	    Clicking on  an item with the left mouse button selects
	    (hilights) it. If you need to select several objects, hold down
	    <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>CTRL</B
> key while clicking. 
	  </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
> 
	    Double-clicking on an item runs the default action for
	    this item (running an application, opening the file, etc.) 
	  </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
> 
	    Clicking on an item with the right mouse button brings up
	    the context menu, which contains all the commands and
	    information available for this item. If you have selected
	    a group of items, right-clicking on any of them will bring
	    up the context menu which applies to all of these items.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>	    You can
	    select text anywhere on the screen using the left mouse
	    button, and then insert this text into any other place on
	    the screen which accepts text input, by clicking with the
	    <A
HREF="conventions.html"
>middle mouse button</A
>.
	  </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>	In addition, clicking with the right mouse button on any empty
	space on your desktop brings up a <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>pop-up</B
>
	menu, which allows you to change desktop background or other
	properties, or add a new item to the desktop. Clicking on the
	desktop with the middle mouse button produces the default menu
	for your window manager (see <A
HREF="windows.html"
>the section called <I
>Working With Windows</I
></A
>).

> To log out of Gnome, click on the <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Main Menu</B
>
	button and select <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Log out</B
>. Gnome
	will prompt you for confirmation; it will also give you an
	option to save the session &#8212; that is, information about
	currently open applications and their location on the screen
	will be saved, so that when you login next time, the same
	applications will be in the same places (this only works for
	applications which are fully Gnome-compliant).
