>	If an application is stalled or frozen &#8212; that is, if it
	does not respond to your mouse clicks and keyboard commands,
	you can either wait and hope that it wakes up, or kill it. If
	you decide to kill it (NOTE: You will lose all unsaved data),
	start the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnome System monitor</TT
>
	(from <B
CLASS="GUISUBMENU"
>System</B
> submenu of the
	<B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Main Menu</B
>), right-click on the frozen
	application name, and select <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Kill
	now</B
>. Using <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnome System
	monitor</TT
> also allows you to find and kill all
	helper processes started by this application.

      &#8212; this is usually the worst solution. Most probably, it is
      not the operating system itself that is frozen (UNIX systems are
      known for stability), but just the graphical part, X Window
      System. In this case, you can try to restart X Window System by
      simultaneously pressing
 
    <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>CTRL</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>ALT</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Backspace</B
>. 
   This should work for
      the implementation of X Window system used on Linux and *BSD,
      XFree86 &#8212; unless it was disabled by your system
      administrator. Of course, in this way you also lose all unsaved
      data, but at least you do not risk to mess up the whole file
      system.

	If you have more serious  problems than just desktop icons &#8212;
	for example, if your panel is missing &#8212; the radical solution
	is to remove all your Gnome configuration files and start from
	scratch. This is an emergency solution, as you lose all
	configuration settings and will need to configure your menus,
	panels, etc. again from scratch, that is, from the default Gnome
	configuration. However, this only affects Gnome configuration,
	so your data files and settings for non-Gnome applications
	remain intact. 
      </P
><P
> To remove all your Gnome configuration files and return
	to the original Gnome configuration, logout then log in again
	holding down keys <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>CTRL</B
> and
	<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>SHIFT</B
> (immediately after entering your
	password in the login dialog). You will be presented a dialog,
	offering you the choice to reset the saved session (that is,
        which applications were open when you last logged out); reset
        your Gnome configuration settings; or both.  
      </P
><P
>	Finally, if you have really severe problems and your system
	freezes or becomes otherwise unusable as soon as you login,
	you have one last option. You can  select
	<B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Failsafe</B
> session type instead of
	the default <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Gnome</B
> in the login
	screen. Both Gnome and KDE Login Managers support this. In
	this session type, Gnome is not started; instead, you are
	presented with a single terminal window. This is almost
	guaranteed to start OK, and if you know how to use
	command-line tools to find and fix your problem, you have a
	chance. Otherwise, ask an expert.
