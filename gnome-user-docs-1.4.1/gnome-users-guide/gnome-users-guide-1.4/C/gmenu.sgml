    The Main Menu is a repository for your applications and can be
    found on the Panel. The Main Menu is preloaded with GNOME but it
    can be configured to fit your work habits. The Main Menu is broken
    up into three main subdirectories: Programs (System menus), Favorites 
    (User menus) and Applets (Panel Apps).  The Menu Editor is available 
    for you to add new applications to the Main Menu but you cannot add
    applications to the System menus if you are not the system
    administrator (root).  In this section you will learn how to add
    applications to your Main Menu.

     The Menu Editor is divided  into two main panels. The left side
     contains the  menu in its default state. The right  side contains a
     tabbed  dialog that  allows you  to add  new applications  to the
     menu.
    </para>
    <para>
     On the left side in the menu tree you will notice that there are
    two main menu lists, one for Favorites (User Menus) and one for
    Programs (System Menus).  The User Menus are for the current user
    and the System Menus are for all users on the system.  The
    prepackaged applications are all located in the System Menus.
    </para>
    <para>
     Within the  menu list  on the  left side you  may open  and close
    folders and  see what is in  your current menu by  clicking on the
    small plus signs beside the menus.

      If you want to add a new menu item press the <guibutton>New
      Item</guibutton> button on the toolbar.  A new menu item will be added to
      the highlighted menu.  If you do not have a menu highlighted, it will
      be placed at the top of the menu tree. Select the new item and type in the
      information for the item in the dialog on the right.  Once the information
      is complete press the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button and the new menu
      item will be inserted at the highlighted location on the left side menu
      tree.  You may then move the menu item by pressing the up or down buttons
      on the toolbar.  You may also move the menu item by dragging it with your
