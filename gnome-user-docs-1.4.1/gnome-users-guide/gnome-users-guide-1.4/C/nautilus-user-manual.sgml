  <title>Introducing Nautilus</title>

   Nautilus is a core component of the GNOME desktop
   environment. Nautilus provides an easy way to view, manage, and
   customize your own files and folders, as well as browse the Web.
  </para>

  <para>
   Nautilus integrates your access to files, applications, media,
   Internet-based resources, and the Web, making it easy and fast for
   you to locate and use all the resources available to you.

  <sect2 id="introdesktop">
   <title>The Nautilus Desktop</title>

   <para>
    The desktop is the background area of your screen. If Nautilus was
    pre-installed on your GNOME system, Nautilus draws the
    desktop. The desktop on your computer can look like your physical
    desktop - it can be full of folders, icons, and works in progress,
    or it can be clear. Nautilus lets you organize it the way
    you want.
   </para>

   <para>
    If Nautilus doesn't already draw the desktop on your system, do
    this:

    represents your home location, an Eazel Services icon that takes
    you to Eazel's Web site, and a Trash icon.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can create folders on the desktop or drag additional files
    and folders from the Nautilus window to the desktop. For instance,
    you can create a folder that contains your current projects and
    keep it on the desktop for easy access. You also mount disks (such
    as floppies or CD-ROMs) on the desktop.

   <para>
    When you first launch Nautilus, you'll see your home folder in the
    Nautilus window. Three areas of the Nautilus window contain
    information about your folder:
   </para>

   <para>
    <inlinegraphic fileref="figures/part-1"></inlinegraphic>

    Your home folder also appears on your desktop, represented by a
    house icon. Double-clicking the house icon opens a new Nautilus
    window with your home folder displayed.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note about the home folder: Depending on your user-level setting,
    your home folder may be the default Nautilus home folder, which
    contains basic information about your computer and pointers to
    some useful applications, or the home folder defined for you in
    your Linux settings (normally /home/<emphasis>your_name</emphasis>).

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Simple searches: If your user level is set to Beginner, Nautilus
      performs a quick and easy search by file name.

    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Complex searches: If your user level is set to Intermediate or

      name, creator, file type, and other attributes, as well as by
      the actual content of files.

   </para>

   <para>
    Nautilus uses Medusa, a daemon, which is a piece of software that
    runs in the background. Medusa creates an index of all the items
    on your hard disk and mounted volumes, including their names,
    size, creation date, and other attributes. In addition, Medusa
    indexes the actual <emphasis>content</emphasis> of each file - so
    you can find any word or phrase in any file on your computer when
    you search by content.
   </para>

   <para>
    Medusa runs when your computer is idle, so it doesn't disrupt your
    activities.
   </para>

   <para>
    If Medusa has not finished indexing your system or is not running
    on your computer, when you do a search you may see a message
    letting you know that Nautilus can't perform a fast search.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you suspect that Medusa is not turned on, do this:

   program must also be running. If you have turned off crond, Medusa

   <title>What Are MIME Types?</title>

   <para>
    MIME types are a standard way to identify files so that they can
    be easily transmitted over the Internet. MIME stands for
    "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extention." Each type of file is
    assigned a specific MIME type. For instance, the MIME type for
    HTML files is "text/html," and the MIME type for JPEG files is
    "image/jpeg." A file's MIME type tells Internet applications such
    as browsers and email programs what type of file is being
    exchanged, how to encode it for transmission, and how to decode it
    when it arrives at its destination.
   </para>

   <para>
    Unless you've specified that a particular application or viewer
    should open a file, it normally opens automatically in an
    application that's appropriate for the type. For instance, a JPEG
    file normally opens automatically in a graphics application.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can choose which application or viewer opens automatically for
    a particular type of file. You can also set up new applications to
    handle particular types of files.

  <title>Default Emblems</title>

  <para>
   Nautilus applies emblems automatically to icons for files that are
   read or write only and to icons that are links (aliases) to other
   files or folders.
  </para>

  <para>
   The default emblems change depending on your theme. The ones shown
   here are for two of the Nautilus themes, but if you have a custom
   theme, your emblems may be different.

  </figure>

  <para>
   A link icon denotes a file that contains no content of its own but
   links to a file or folder located elsewhere on the
   computer. Clicking this icon opens the linked file or folder. (A
   link is similar to a shortcut in Windows or an alias in the Mac
   OS.)
