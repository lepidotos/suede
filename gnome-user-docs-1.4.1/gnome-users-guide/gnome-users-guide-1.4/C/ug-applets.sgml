   <title>What Are Applets?</title> 
   <para>
    Applets are one of the most popular and useful objects you can add
    to your <interface>Panel</interface> to customize your desktop.
    An applet is a small application which runs inside a small area of
    your <interface>Panel</interface>. Applets have been written for
    a wide range of purposes.  Some are very powerful interactive
    tools, such as the <application>Mixer</application> Applet
    which allows you to easily control your system sound.
    Others are simple system
    monitors, displaying information such as the amount of power left
    in the battery on your laptop (see <application>Battery Charge
    Monitor</application>) or weather
    information(see <application>GNOME Weather</application>).  Some
    are simply for amusement(see <application>gEyes</application>).
   </para>

   <para>
    Applets are similar to swallowed applications in that both of them
    reside within the <interface>Panel</interface>. However, 
    swallowed applications are generally applications which were
    not designed to run within the <interface>Panel</interface>.
    Typically one will swallow an application which already exists in
    the main <interface>desktop</interface> area, putting it into your
    <interface>Panel</interface>.  The application will continue to
    run in the <interface>Panel</interface> until you end the
    application or  unswallow it,  placing it back onto the main part of
    your desktop when you need to.

    Several example applets are shown in <xref
    linkend="example-applets-fig2">.  From left to right, they are: (1)
    <application>Mixer Applet</application>, which allows you to turn
    on/off sound and control its volume by clicking on the applet.  (2)
    <application>Sound Monitor</application> Applet, which displays
    the current volume of sound being played and allows you to control
    various sound features.  (3) <application>GTCD</application>
    Applet, a CD player which has all its controls
    available in the applet and displays the track and time. (4)
    <application>Drive Mount</application> Applet, used to mount and
    unmount drives with a single click of the mouse. (5)
    <application>Desk Guide</application> which allows you to view and
    control multiple virtual screens. (6)
    <application>Tasklist</application> Applet which allows you to control
    your various windows and applications.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are many other applets to choose from.  The rest of this
    chapter will explain the basic information to get you started
    adding, moving, and removing applets from your
    <interface>Panels</interface> and using them. The following
    chapters go through each of the standard GNOME applets describing
    them in detail.  There are also additional applets which can be
    downloaded off the Web.   See <ulink type="http"
     url="http://www.gnome.org/applist/list-martin.phtml">The GNOME
    Software Map</ulink> for lists of additional GNOME applications
    and applets. 
   </para>
   <para>
    As you read through the the rest of this chapter, you should try
    adding and removing applets from your <interface>Panel</interface> and
    experiment with them freely.

   <title>Adding, Moving, and Removing Applets</title>

   <sect3 id="adding-applets">   
    <title>Adding Applets to a Panel</title>
    <para>
     To add an applet to a <interface>Panel</interface>, right-click
     on the <interface>Panel</interface> and select 
     <menuchoice><guimenu>Panel</guimenu><guisubmenu>Add to panel</guisubmenu>
     <guisubmenu>Applet</guisubmenu></menuchoice>. This will show you
     the menu of all the applets on your system, divided into
     categories. Choosing any applet from this menu will add it to the
     <interface>Panel</interface>.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="moving-applets">
    <title>Moving Applets In or Between Panels</title>
    <para>
     It is easy to move applets in a <interface>Panel</interface> or
     between two <interface>Panels</interface>. If you have a
     three-button mouse, just move the mouse over the applet, depress
     the middle mouse button and drag the applet to its new location,
     releasing the middle mouse button when you are finished.  Note
     that you can drag applets within a <interface>Panel</interface>
     or between two <interface>Panels</interface> this way. If you
     don't have a three-button mouse, just 
     right-click on the applet and choose
     <guimenuitem>Move</guimenuitem>. The cursor will turn into a
     cross and the applet will move with your mouse until you press
     any mouse button to indicate you are finished moving it.
     If, in the course of this movement, it hits
     other objects, the behavior depends on the global preferences
     you have set for your <interface>Panels</interface> in the
     <application>GNOME Control Center</application>: the applet you are
     moving can switch places with other objects, "push" all objects
     it meets, or "jump" over all other objects without disturbing
     them. You can also override the default behavior by holding
     <keycap>Shift</keycap> button (for "push" mode),
     <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> (for "switched" mode), or
     <keycap>Alt</keycap> (for "free" mode, i.e. jumping other other
     objects without disturbing them) button while dragging.
    </para>
    <para>
     To change the global Panel preferences, right-click on any applet
     or <interface>Panel</interface> and select 
     <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Panel</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>Global Preferences...</guimenuitem>
     </menuchoice>.
     The <guilabel>Default movement mode</guilabel> is set under the
     <guilabel>Applets</guilabel> tab.

  <!-- #### Intro | The Right-Click Pop-Up Menu ###### -->
  <sect2 id="right-click-pop-up-menu">
   <title>The Right-Click Pop-Up Menu</title>
   <para>
    Clicking the right mouse button on any applet brings up
    a <guimenu>pop-up menu</guimenu>. This 
    menu always has certain standard menu items in it and
    often has additional items which vary depending on the particular
    applet. 
   </para>
   <sect3 id="standard-right-click-items"> 
    <title>Standard Pop-Up Items</title>
    <para>
     All applets have the following items in their right-click
     <guimenu>pop-up menu</guimenu>:
     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Remove from panel</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         The <guimenuitem>Remove from panel</guimenuitem> menu item
         removes the applet from the <interface>Panel</interface>. 
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Move</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         After selecting <guimenuitem>Move</guimenuitem>, your mouse
         pointer will change appearance (typically to a cross with
         arrows in each direction). As you move your mouse, the applet
         will move with it.  When you have finished moving the applet,
         click any mouse button and the applet will anchor in its
         current position.  Note that applets can be moved between two
         <interface>Panels</interface> this way.
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Panel</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         The <guisubmenu>Panel</guisubmenu> submenu contains various
         items and submenus for adding and removing
         <interface>Panels</interface> and applets and for changing
         the configuration.

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Help</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         The <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem> menu item brings up the help
         manual for the applet.

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>About</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         The <guimenuitem>About...</guimenuitem> menu item brings up a 
         dialogue box containing various information about the applet,
         typically including the applet's  name, version, author,
         copyright, license and desciption. 
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="common-right-click-items"> 
    <title>Other Common Pop-Up Items</title>
    <para>
     Many applets also have other items in their right-click pop-up
     menus.  Some of the more common ones are:
     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Properties...</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         The <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item opens
         the Properties dialog (see <xref
         linkend="applet-properties-dialog">) for the applet. Many
         applets have properties dialogs, which allow you to configure
         the behavior and appearance of the applet.
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>  
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Run...</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         The <guimenuitem>Run...</guimenuitem> menu item generally
         invokes a program  which is related to the applet in some way
         but which runs in its own window rather than in the
         panel. For example: 
        </para>
        <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           The <application>CPU Load</application> applet, which monitors
           what programs are running, has a <guimenuitem>Run
           gtop...</guimenuitem>  menu item. Selecting this menu item
           starts <application>GTop</application>, which allows you to
           view and control programs which are running.
          </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           The <application>CD Player</application> applet has a
           <guimenuitem>Run gtcd...</guimenuitem> menu item which
           starts the GNOME <application>CD Player</application> when
           selected, which has more capabilities than the applet.
          </para>
         </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="applet-properties-dialog"> 
    <title>The Applet Properties Dialog</title>
    <para>
     Many applets have customizable properties.  These applets will
     have a <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item in their
     right-click <guimenu>pop-up menu</guimenu> which brings up the
     <interface>Properties</interface> dialog where you can alter the 
     appearance or behaviour of the applet.
