    The GNOME Desktop provides the functionality of any traditional operating
    system desktop. You can drag files, programs and directory folders to the
    desktop; you can also drag those items back into GNOME-compliant
    applications, allowing you to quickly access any items you select.

     The GNOME Desktop is actually provided by a backend process in the GNOME
     File Manager. If, for any reason, that backend process has stopped running
     you may start the Nautilus File Manager again and your desktop will be
     restored.  Even if you do have to do this you do not need to keep the 
     Nautilus File Manager window open to enable the desktop.

   <title>Using the Desktop</title>
   <para>
    Using the Desktop is as simple as dragging items you wish to use
    routinely to the desktop. The default desktop includes a
    folder of your home directory (usually <filename>/home/[user
    name]</filename>).  By default the Nautilus File Manager window will
    also appear so you can quickly access other areas of your system.
   </para>
    <para>
      Once an item is on the desktop you can double-click on it to perform its
      default action or right-click on it (click on it using the mouse's right
      button) to see a menu of actions that can be performed on it.  The default
      action depends on the kind of item it is; if it's a program, that program
      will start, if it's data, the appropriate program will be started with
      that data loaded, and if it's a directory, a file manager window will be
      opened showing that directory's contents.
    </para>
   <para>
    To use drag and drop you need to be using either a GNOME compliant
    application or a Motif application.  GNOME is compliant with Motif drag and
    drop so you will find it works with many applications you already have
    installed.
   </para>
   <para>
    All items that are stored on your desktop are located in the following
    directory:
    <programlisting>
     <prompt>$</prompt>/home/[user name]/.nautilus/desktop/  
    </programlisting>
    This is helpful to remember when you want your desktop to contain an item
    for which you cannot use drag and drop.

    Once you have started GNOME you can mount CDROM or floppy drives you have
    connected to your system by right clicking on the desktop and selecting the
    disks menu. This will show an icon on your desktop that you can use to
    access these drives.
   </para>

     You must have permission to mount the device shown on your desktop before
     you can use these icons. If you do not have mount permission someone
     with root access such as your system administrator can give it as
     follows. You can read more about this and other items of system knowledge
     in <xref linkend="newbies">. 
    </para>

      Giving mount access to ordinary users can be done quite easily if you have
      <application><emphasis>linuxconf</emphasis></application> installed on
      your machine.  Just select the drive you want to access in the
      <guilabel>Access local drive</guilabel> section.  In the
      <guilabel>Options</guilabel> tab select the <guilabel>User
      Mountable</guilabel> option.  Your drive will now be mountable by users.
     </para>
     <para>
      If <application><emphasis>linuxconf</emphasis></application> is not
      available someone with root access must edit the
      <emphasis>/etc/fstab</emphasis> file to include user access. This is done
      by adding the user attribute to the drive. For example:
     </para>
     <para>
      If your fstab file contains a line like this:
      <programlisting>
       /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom iso9660 exec,dev,ro,noauto 0 0
      </programlisting>
      Add "user" to the fourth column:
     <programlisting>
      /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom iso9660 user,exec,dev,ro,noauto 0 0
     </programlisting>
     </para>
     <para>
      Depending on your system and work environment, there could be some
      security risks in permitting users to mount disks. Please consult your
      system administrator before taking this action.

   </indexterm>
    Desktop areas allow you to keep a well organized system when you have many
    tasks to perform at one time. Just like adding a new desk when you have too
    much material to fit on one, desktop areas allow you to move to another area
    to launch more programs.
   </para>
   <para>
    GNOME is aware of desktop areas even though they are controlled by another
    software program called the 'window manager'. You can set the number of
    desktop areas within the configuration of the window manager you are
    using. If you are using the default window manager or your window manager
    has a graphical configuration tool you may be able to launch it from the
    Window Manager Capplet. You may read more about this Capplet in <xref
    linkend="gccwm">
   </para>
   <important>
    <title>IMPORTANT</title>
    <para>
     Most window managers will give you the option of having multiple desktops,
     which are different from desktop areas.  Desktop areas are virtual
     extensions of one desktop whereas multiple desktops are actually separate.
    </para>
    <para>
     The default setup of GNOME is to use desktop areas with only one
     desktop. The reason for this is with some applications, such as those which
     use Motif, users can experience problems with some drag and drop
     functionality across desktops.

    There are a few desktop menus you may use in GNOME. These menus are accessed
    by making a right-button mouse click on any clean space on the desktop. This
    will bring up a <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu which contains a few items:
