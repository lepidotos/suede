      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>
	The <application>Gnome Control Center</application> allows you
	to configure various parts of your system using a collection
	of tools called <quote>capplets</quote>. These capplets may be
	associated with the core set of Gnome applications or other
	applications for which the developers have written capplets.
      </para>
      <para>
	Your <application>Control Center</application> may contain
	more capplets than are documented here depending on the
	applications installed on your system.
    </para>
    <para> <application>Control Center</application> is a part of
      Gnome desktop environment; it is included in
      <filename>control-center</filename> package. This manual
      describes version 1.4 of <application>Control
      Center</application>. 
    </para>



      <para>
	You may start the <application>Control Center</application>
	one of three ways. To launch the <application>Control
	Center</application> without any particular active capplet
	select the <guimenuitem>Control Center</guimenuitem> menu item
	from the <guisubmenu>Settings</guisubmenu> submenu in the
	<guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu> or type the
	command <command>gnomecc</command> at the command line
	prompt. 
      </para>
      <para>
	If you know which capplet you would like to edit you may start
	that capplet by selecting the correct menu item in the
	<guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu.
      </para>

  <!-- ############ Usage ################ -->
  <sect1 id="gnomecc-usage">
    <title>Using the Control Center</title>
      <para>
	The <application>Control Center</application> is divided into
	two main sections, the menu of configurable capplets on the
	left and the main work space on the right. The capplets in the
	menu are grouped in sections, such as
	<guilabel>Desktop</guilabel>, <guilabel>Multimedia</guilabel>,
	etc. Each of these sections is discussed in detail below. As
	with all menus of this type, you can <quote>collapse</quote> a
	whole section by clicking on the small downward triangle to
	the left of the section title. To expand a collapsed section,
	click on the triangle again.
      </para>
      <para>
	Working with the <application>Control Center</application>
	simply requires you to select a capplet from the menu on the
	left and click on it. Once this is done, the workspace will
	change, allowing you to configure the item.
      </para>
      <para>After you have made the configuration changes, you can
      press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button to confirm the changes
      or <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> to return to the old
      configuration. It you want to test the new settings before
      making your decision press <guibutton>Try</guibutton> button;
      this will apply the new cofiguration settings so that you can
      see what they would look like, but it also remembers the old
      ones. After you have tried the new settings, you can press
      <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button to make them permanent, or
      <guibutton>Revert</guibutton> to return to the old
      configuration.

	  The properties for your background image can be set here by
	  either selecting a color or an image. If you select a color
	  you have the option of having <guilabel>Solid</guilabel>,
	  <guilabel>Horizontal Gradient</guilabel> (the color smoothly
	  changes from left to right) and  <guilabel>Vertical
	  Gradient</guilabel> (the color changes from top to bottom).
	  For gradient backgrounds, you need to select two colors:
	  beginning (primary) and ending (secondary) one.
	</para>
        <para>
	If you decide to have an image as wallpaper you may browse for
	the image you wish to use.  Once you have found your image you
	need to decide whether you would like to have the image tiled
	across the screen, centered, scaled up while keeping the same
	aspect, or simply scaled up to fit the screen. Once you have
	changed your background properties you may press the
	<guibutton>Try</guibutton> button at the bottom of the
	<application>Control Center</application> to make the change.
      </para>

	  GTK themes are coordinated settings that define the look and

	  hence the name).

	<para>
	  To change your GTK theme select a theme from the
	  <guilabel>Available Themes</guilabel> list on the left side
	  of the main workspace. If you have <guibutton>Auto
	  Preview</guibutton> selected you will be able to see what
	  the theme looks like in the preview window below. Note that
	  the preview window is <quote>live</quote>: you can click on
	  a button, enter text in sample text entry box, etc. If you
	  like the theme press the <guibutton>Try</guibutton> button
	  on the bottom of the <application>Gnome Control
	  Center</application> to install it.
	</para>
	<para>
	  There are a few GTK themes that come loaded with Gnome when
	  you install it.  If you would like more themes you can check
	  resources on the Internet such as the <ulink

	  site</ulink>.  Once you have found and downloaded a theme
	  you like, press the <guibutton>Install new theme</guibutton>
	  button. This will launch a file browser that allows you to
	  find the theme you have just downloaded. The theme files
	  should be in a <filename>tar.gz</filename> or

	  The Gnome Mime Types Capplet allows you to determine how you wish

	  you can define certain Mime types to be handled in any manner you
	  wish. For example, if you use .sgml files frequently and you wish
	  to always use Emacs to edit them you can configure the .sgml Mime
	  type to always be handled by Emacs. This means that any program
	  that wishes to launch the mime type for you will bring up
	  Emacs. This includes double clicking on the file icon in the
	  Gnome File Manager.

      This capplet allows you to configure how files of various types

      contains. For each of the file types, you can set the icon to be
      used by the File Manager, the default application to be used to
      open files of this type, etc. For example, file type
      <systemitem>image/jpeg</systemitem> is used for image files in

      This capplet allows you configure application launch feedback,

      an hourglass icon next to mouse cursor or a blinking star) come
      to life the moment you click on the application launch button or 
      select it in the menu and stay on until the application actually
      starts or until specified time has passed. These indicators can
      be very useful in cases when an application takes a long time to
      start: without them, you would never know whether the
      application is just taking a long time to start, or something
      went wrong (e.g., it has crashed at startup, or you maybe you
      didn't click on that button at all).

	     Gnome-compatible. For Gnome applications, it is easier

	  The default style in Gnome-compliant applications for MDI is

	  default tab look described above;
	  <guilabel>Toplevel</guilabel> displays only the active
	  document on the top view until it is closed and
	  <guilabel>Modal</guilabel> has only one toplevel which can
	  contain any of the documents at any one time, however only
	  one can be displayed. If you have ever used
	  <application>Emacs</application>, <guilabel>Modal</guilabel>
	  is very similar to the way <application>Emacs</application>

	  you may then decide where you want the tabs to appear in
	  your applications. You may have them at the top, left,
	  right, or bottom of your application. Keep in mind that
	  these choices will affect only applications that are Gnome
	  compliant.
