      In Unix and Linux, nearly all graphical applications use the 
      <ulink url="http://www.xfree86.org" type="http">"X Window System"</ulink>
      as the underlying software between the hardware and the "graphical 
      user interface" (GUI). The window manager is the piece of software 
      that controls the display windows in the X Window System environment. The 
      placement, borders, and decorations of any window are managed by the 
      window manager. GNOME works with the window manager to display application 
      windows on your screen.

     GNOME is not dependent on any particular window manager. If you decide to change
     window managers GNOME will maintain a consistent interface to your applications.
     GNOME works with the window manager to get information about the windows on the 
     screen.  However, some GNOME features require a "GNOME compliant window
     manager" to work correctly, in particular the Desk Guide applet as well as
     drag and drop on the desktop.  We recommend the use of a GNOME compliant 
     window manager for new users.

     Some of the window managers that have partial to full compliance at the
     time of this version of the GNOME User's Guide are:

     There are other window managers being developed that will work
     with GNOME. You can find some of these on the <ulink

      At any time you may change the window manager you are using by utilizing
      the Window Manager Capplet in the GNOME Control Center. You may read more

       Keep in mind that the window manager you choose to use may not be
       compliant with GNOME and you may not benefit from some of the GNOME
       features if you use it.
