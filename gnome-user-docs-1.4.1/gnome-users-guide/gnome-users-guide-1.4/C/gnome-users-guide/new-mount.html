>      As we mentioned earlier, the directories on a UNIX system are
      organized in a tree, with the top level directory being
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>. Unlike some other operating systems such as
      MS-DOS, there are no special names for files on your floppy disk or
      CD-ROM: <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>all</I
> the files accessible to your system
      must appear in the main directory tree starting with
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>      Thus, before you can access files on a floppy diskette or a
      CD-ROM, you must give to your system a command to incorporate
      the contents of this diskette into the main directory tree,
      which is referred to as <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>mounting</I
> the
      diskette. You can think of it as the software analog of
      connecting the drive to your system.  Typically the contents of
      the CD-ROM will appear under the name
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/cdrom</TT
>; the floppy diskette under
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/floppy</TT
> (these are called the
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>mount points</I
> and are defined in the special
      configuration file, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/fstab</TT
>). Accessing
      a drive in this fashion doesn't mean that the system will copy
      all the files from the CD to the directory
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/cdrom</TT
>. Instead, it means that the
      directory <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/cdrom</TT
>
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>represents</I
> the CD-ROM: When a program tries
      to access, say, a file called
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/cdrom/index.html</TT
>, the system will look
      for file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>index.html</TT
> on the CD-ROM.
    </P
><P
>      So, in short: before you can use files on a drive, you must
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"mount"</SPAN
> it. Similarly, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>before removing
      the disk from the drive, you must unmount it.</I
>
    </P
><P
>      When using GNOME, you usually do not have to worry about
      mounting and unmounting: GNOME scans the appropriate
      configuration file and places the icons for all drives on your
      desktop. Double-clicking on any of these icons automatically
      mounts the corresponding drive (if it was not already mounted)
      and starts the file manager in the appropriate directory.
      Similarly, if you right-click on the drive icon and choose the
      command <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Eject device</B
> from the pop-up
      menu, GNOME automatically unmounts it before ejecting. You can
      also mount/unmount a drive by right-clicking on its icon on the
      desktop and choosing <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Mount device</B
> or
      <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Unmount device</B
> from the pop-up menu,
      or by using the disk mount applet.
    </P
><P
>      Note that you can't unmount a drive if it is being used by some
      program; for example, if you have a terminal windows open in a
      directory on the drive you're trying to unmount. So, if you get
      the error message <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Device busy"</SPAN
> while trying to
      unmount a drive, make sure that none of your open applications
      is accessing a file or directory on this drive.
    </P
><P
>      However, GNOME cannot prevent you from ejecting the disk using the
      physical eject button on the drive itself &#8212; in this case,
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>it is your responsibility to unmount the drive</I
>
      before doing so. For CD and Zip drives, the system blocks the eject
      button on the drive while the drive is mounted; for floppy drives this
      is technically impossible.

> Some systems are running special programs such as

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>magicdev</TT
>
      which automatically mount a drive when a disk is inserted and unmount a
      drive if it hasn't been used for a specified period of time. In
      this case, you will probably never need to worry about
      mounting/unmounting drives yourself; you don't even need to read
      this section. 
    </P
><P
>      Allowing users to mount and unmount drives carries some security
      risks, so many multi-user systems are configured so that only
      root can mount or unmount drives. This is the most probable
      cause of error messages you may be getting while trying to mount
      a drive. In this case, discuss this matter with your system
      administrator.
    </P
><P
>      If the computer is your personal workstation or home computer
      and you are not worried about security, you can give mount
      permission to ordinary users. The easiest way to allow this is
      to use the application
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>linuxconf</I
></TT
> (which
      can only be run by root).  Just select the drive you want to
      access in the <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Access local drive</B
></TT
> section.
      In the <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Options</B
></TT
> tab select the
      <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>User Mountable</B
></TT
> option.  Your drive will now
      be mountable by users.

>      If <TT

>linuxconf</I

> is
      not available, then you must manually edit the file
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/fstab</TT

      done by adding the <SPAN
