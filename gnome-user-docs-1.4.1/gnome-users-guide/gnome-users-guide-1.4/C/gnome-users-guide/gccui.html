	  The Dialogs Capplet will allow you to change the default settings for
	  dialog boxes in Gnome compliant applications.  A dialog box is a
	  window that is launched by an application to help perform a task
	  needed by that application. An example of a dialog box is a Print
	  dialog which appears when you press a print button. The dialog allows
	  you to set print options and start the print process.  The Dialogs
	  capplet will allow you to change the following options.
