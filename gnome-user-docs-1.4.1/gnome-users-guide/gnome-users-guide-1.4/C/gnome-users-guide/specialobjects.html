    is very convenient when you need to enter just one command

    choose a file &#8212; this filename will be appended to the end of
    your command. For example, you can enter
    <TT

><B
>emacs</B
></TT

    on the command line and then use the

>    You can run many applications which are not applets inside the
    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
> as if they were applets.
    Applications which you pull into the <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
>,
    even though they are not GNOME applets, are called "swallowed
    applications".  Applications do not have to be GNOME-compliant to
    be swallowed.  In general, the only constraints for swallowing an
    application are that the application must be small enough to fit
    in your <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
> and you must know the  title
    of the window you would like to swallow.  In many cases, the
    application can be automatically shrank to fit in the
    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
>,  as specified in the
    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Create Swallowed Application Dialog</SPAN
>.  If
    the application is not small enough to fit in the
    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
>, the <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
>
    will generally grow to allow the application to fit.

CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Title of application to swallow</B

    window title, typically displayed on the top left edge of the

    <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"

CLASS="GUILABEL"

    determine the size of the swallowed application in the

   </P
><P
>    If you leave the <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Command</B

    dialog will create an empty window of given size on the panel
    which will sit there waiting for a window with the given title to
    appear on your desktop. As soon such a window appears (for
    example, when you choose appropriate item in the menu), it will be
    swallowed.
   </P
><P

CLASS="GUILABEL"

>Command</B

    field; this command will be executed before trying to swallowing
    the window to the <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
> (and  each time the
    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN

    normally used to start an application which you want the

><P
>    The <SPAN

    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
> object which can hold status docklets
    &#8212; small windows which applications place in the
    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>status dock</SPAN
> to provide status information.
    Status docklets can also be used to control the
    application. Essentially, docklets are small (both in size and in
    complexity) applets.   GNOME currently does not have many
    applications which place status docklets in the <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>status
    dock</SPAN
>.  However, GNOME's <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>status
    dock</SPAN
> is compatible with that of the K Desktop
    Environment (KDE), so KDE applications, such as
    <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>kscd</TT
>, may place status docklets in
    GNOME's <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>status dock</SPAN
>.  Future versions of
    GNOME applications will make use of this recently added
    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
> object.
