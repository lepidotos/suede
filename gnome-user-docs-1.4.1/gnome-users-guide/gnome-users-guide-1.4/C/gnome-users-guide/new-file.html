>      Under most operating systems (including UNIX), there is the
      concept of a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>file</I
>, which is just a bundle of
      information given a name (called a
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>filename</I
>). Examples of files might be
      your history term paper, an e-mail message, or an actual
      program that can be executed. Essentially, anything saved on
      disk is saved in an individual file.

>	Files are identified by their filenames. For example, the file
	containing your conference talk might be saved with the filename
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>talk.txt</TT
>. There is no standard format for file
	names as there is under MS-DOS and some other operating systems; in
	general, a filename can contain any character (except the /
	character&#8211;see the discussion of path names below) and is
	limited to 256 characters in length.

> It is customary to use the format
	      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>filename.extension</TT
> for filenames,
	      where the extension indicates the file type; for
	      example, the extension <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>txt</TT
> is
	      usually used for plain text files, while the extension
	      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>jpeg</TT
> is used for graphics in JPEG
	      format, and so on. In particular, the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME
	      File Manager</TT
>
	      (<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Nautilus</TT
>) uses extensions to
	      determine file type. You can view or change file
	      extensions recognized by
	      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME</TT

CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>MIME types</B
> in
	      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Control Center</TT

	      that the standard convention in UNIX is that the
	      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>executables</I
> (i.e., the program
	      files) have no extension at all.

> Files and directories whose names begin with a dot
	      (.) are usually <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>configuration
		files</I
>, that is, files which keep settings and
	      preferences for various applications. For example, GNOME
	      keeps all its settings in various files in the directories
	      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.gnome</TT
> and
	      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.gnome-desktop</TT
> in the user's home
	      directory. Since most of the time you do not need to
	      edit these files manually, or even know their precise
	      names and locations, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Nautilus</TT
>
	      usually doesn't show these files. You can change this
	      setting as described in <A

> myfile.txt</TT
> with
	    <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>emacs</TT

>When entering commands from the command line, you can use
	so-called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>wildcards</I
> instead of an exact
	filename. The most common wildcard is *, which matches any
	sequence of symbols (including an empty string). For example,
	the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ls *.txt</B
> will list all the files with
	the extension <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>txt</TT
>, and the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rm
	  chapter*</B

	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>chapter</TT
> (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ls</B
> and
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rm</B
> are UNIX 
	commands for listing and removing files). Another useful
	wildcard is ?, which matches any single symbol: for example,
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rm chapter?.txt</B
> will remove files
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>chapter1.txt, chapter2.txt</TT
> , but not
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>chapter10.txt</TT
>
      </P
><P
>Most new GNOME users prefer using the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME
	  File Manager</TT
> for operations with files, rather
	  than working from the command line. Wildcards can also be
	  used in  <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Nautilus</TT

	  selection and view filter dialogs.  </P

	letters and numbers, but also spaces, commas, etc. &#8212; any
	characters other than slash (/). However, if you are using
	commands typed on the command line, you should be careful when
	dealing with such files. To avoid problems, it is advised that
	you enclose  filenames that contain anything other than
	letters, numbers, and dots,  in single quotes: to delete file
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>My File</TT

CLASS="COMMAND"

CLASS="COMMAND"
>rm My

	File Manager, than you do not  need to worry about this: to
