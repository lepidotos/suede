>      This capplet allows you configure application launch feedback,
      i.e. indicators which tell you that a program is being
      loaded. Such indicators, which can take a number of forms (i.e.,
      an hourglass icon next to mouse cursor or a blinking star) come
      to life the moment you click on the application launch button or 
      select it in the menu and stay on until the application actually
      starts or until specified time has passed. These indicators can
      be very useful in cases when an application takes a long time to
      start: without them, you would never know whether the
      application is just taking a long time to start, or something
      went wrong (e.g., it has crashed at startup, or you maybe you
      didn't click on that button at all).
