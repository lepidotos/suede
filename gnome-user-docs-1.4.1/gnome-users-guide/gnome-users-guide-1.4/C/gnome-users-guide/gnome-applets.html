><P
>    Applets are one of the most popular and useful objects you can add
    to your <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
> to customize your desktop.
    An applet is a small application which runs inside a small area of
    your <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
>. Applets have been written for
    a wide range of purposes.  Some are very powerful interactive
    tools, such as the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Mixer</TT
> Applet
    which allows you to easily control your system sound.
    Others are simple system
    monitors, displaying information such as the amount of power left
    in the battery on your laptop (see <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Battery Charge
    Monitor</TT
>) or weather
    information(see <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Weather</TT
>).  Some
    are simply for amusement(see <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>gEyes</TT
>).
   </P
><P
>    Applets are similar to swallowed applications in that both of them
    reside within the <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
>. However, 
    swallowed applications are generally applications which were
    not designed to run within the <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
>.
    Typically one will swallow an application which already exists in
    the main <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>desktop</SPAN
> area, putting it into your
    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
>.  The application will continue to
    run in the <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
> until you end the
    application or  unswallow it,  placing it back onto the main part of
    your desktop when you need to.

    Several example applets are shown in <A
HREF="gnome-applets.html#EXAMPLE-APPLETS-FIG2"
>Figure 1</A
>.  From left to right, they are: (1)
    <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Mixer Applet</TT
>, which allows you to turn
    on/off sound and control its volume by clicking on the applet.  (2)
    <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Sound Monitor</TT
> Applet, which displays
    the current volume of sound being played and allows you to control
    various sound features.  (3) <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GTCD</TT
>
    Applet, a CD player which has all its controls
    available in the applet and displays the track and time. (4)
    <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Drive Mount</TT
> Applet, used to mount and
    unmount drives with a single click of the mouse. (5)
    <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Desk Guide</TT
> which allows you to view and
    control multiple virtual screens. (6)
    <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Tasklist</TT
> Applet which allows you to control
    your various windows and applications.
   </P
><P
>    There are many other applets to choose from.  The rest of this
    chapter will explain the basic information to get you started
    adding, moving, and removing applets from your
    <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panels</SPAN
> and using them. The following
    chapters go through each of the standard GNOME applets describing
    them in detail.  There are also additional applets which can be
    downloaded off the Web.   See <A

    Software Map</A

    and applets.

>    As you read through the the rest of this chapter, you should try
    adding and removing applets from your <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN

    experiment with them freely.

NAME="MOVING-APPLETS"

><P
>     It is easy to move applets in a <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
> or
     between two <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panels</SPAN
>. If you have a
     three-button mouse, just move the mouse over the applet, depress
     the middle mouse button and drag the applet to its new location,
     releasing the middle mouse button when you are finished.  Note
     that you can drag applets within a <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
>
     or between two <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panels</SPAN
> this way. If you
     don't have a three-button mouse, just 
     right-click on the applet and choose
     <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Move</B
>. The cursor will turn into a
     cross and the applet will move with your mouse until you press
     any mouse button to indicate you are finished moving it.
     If, in the course of this movement, it hits
     other objects, the behavior depends on the global preferences
     you have set for your <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panels</SPAN
> in the
     <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Control Center</TT
>: the applet you are
     moving can switch places with other objects, "push" all objects
     it meets, or "jump" over all other objects without disturbing
     them. You can also override the default behavior by holding
     <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Shift</B
> button (for "push" mode),
     <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Ctrl</B
> (for "switched" mode), or
     <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Alt</B
> (for "free" mode, i.e. jumping other other
     objects without disturbing them) button while dragging.
