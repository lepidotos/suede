>      This capplet allows you to configure how files of various types
      should be handled. File type (formally called MIME type)
      describes what kind of data and in what format the file
      contains. For each of the file types, you can set the icon to be
      used by the File Manager, the default application to be used to
      open files of this type, etc. For example, file type
      <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>image/jpeg</SPAN
> is used for image files in
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>JPEG</TT
> format; by default, it is opened using
      File Manager's built-in graphics viewer.
