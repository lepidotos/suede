>What Are MIME Types?</A
></H2
><P
>    MIME types are a standard way to identify files so that they can
    be easily transmitted over the Internet. MIME stands for
    "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extention." Each type of file is
    assigned a specific MIME type. For instance, the MIME type for
    HTML files is "text/html," and the MIME type for JPEG files is
    "image/jpeg." A file's MIME type tells Internet applications such
    as browsers and email programs what type of file is being
    exchanged, how to encode it for transmission, and how to decode it
    when it arrives at its destination.
   </P
><P
>    Unless you've specified that a particular application or viewer
    should open a file, it normally opens automatically in an
    application that's appropriate for the type. For instance, a JPEG
    file normally opens automatically in a graphics application.
   </P
><P
>    You can choose which application or viewer opens automatically for
    a particular type of file. You can also set up new applications to
    handle particular types of files.

    file.
