What is GHex
============

GHex allows the user to load data from any file, view and edit it in either
hex or ascii. A must for anyone playing games that use non-ascii format for
saving.


System Requirements
===================

GHex should build on (I guess) most unices. It needs the X11R6 libraries,
glib, gdk and gtk 1.2.x libraries and GNOME 1.0.x libraries.
