The Eel source tree is available from CVS (the latest-cutting edge
version) and in releases (tarballs).

If you plan to hack on Eel, please make sure you work from the
CVS version. The CVS version is available on GNOME CVS. The page
http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html details how to get started
with GNOME CVS.

If you would like to hack on Eel, or have patches, please send
them to the Nautilus mailing list:

<nautilus-list@lists.eazel.com>

We use the Nautilus mailing list because the code in Eel was 
originally part of Nautilus.  If there is enough interest in
discussing Eel on this list, we will create a new mailing list
as soon as the traffic warrants it.

Patches should be made with 'cvs diff -pu >patch' and should conform to
Nautilus coding style as described in docs/style-guide.html Please
read other relevant documents in the docs directory too.
