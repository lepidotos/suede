ProcBar: done.
PropertyBox: done.
Properties/Property-Entries: Probably libgnomeui internals.
Stock: Not sure.
  - should we place Gnome::Stock::Pixmaps in there with all available pixmaps
    by name, or just make an enum in Gnome::Stock::Pixmap?

Ted: obsolete (removed)
Window-Icon: Not a widget - more helper functions.
Winhints: Functions for gnome-specific WM hints.
         Acts on Gtk::Widget so it couldn't be a subclass.
         Low priority. Maybe it's an internal.

FOR THE FUTURE:
---------------

AppHelper: 
  - Separate Toolbar and MenuShell stuff?
    Complain to Gnome that there should be a Gnome::Toolbar instead 
    of these orphaned gnome_app_fill_toolbar* methods sitting here 
    where it's too late to add them as Gtk::Toolbar methods. murrayc
    
    Havoc says that this might be fixed in GNOME 2.2, but that there
    is not a definite plan about how to do it, and that he does not
    want to make a partial fix before then. murrayc.

    There is now talk of killing GnomeApp for GNOME 2.0, and forcing
    use of the bonobo stuff instead. murrayc.

Dialog:
  -   Need to whine to GNOME that there should be a UI::Info method of 
  filling a dialog.
