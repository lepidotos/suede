	* eval.c: fix 64bit issues when scanning /proc

2001-08-08  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* \*.desktop: Added zh_TW.Big5 (traditional Chinese) strings.

2001-07-13  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* utils.c (str_to_gdouble): Handle NULL strings gracefully.

	* chart.c, chart.h (chart_parameter_add): Add four additional
	parameters: {top,bot}_{min,max}.  Copy these into the
	corresponding datum values.
	(chart_rescale_by_table): Use any user-specified top_max as the
	maximum upper bound, rather than using the largest table value
	less than top_max.

	* eval.c (chart_equation_add): Set {top,bot}_{min,max} to the
	values obtained from the parameter specification, or to +/-
	G_MAXDOUBLE if no value was supplied.

	* utils.c, utils.h (str_to_gdouble): New helper function used in
	the preceding change.

	This batch of rescaling changes was developed and submitted by
	Joachim Breuer <jmbreuer@gmx.net>

2001-07-11  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* strip.c (strip_overlay_indicators): Draw indicators
	left-to-right in the same order that they appear in the parameter
	notebook.

	* chart.c (chart_parameter_add): Insert new parameters
	corresponding to the location of the page in the parameter
	notebook.

	* chart-app.h (struct): Remove plist; adjust code to get parameter
	pages by iterating through notebook pages and getting the
	user_data associated with each.

	* utils.c: Fix a compilation problem under Solaris 2.6 reported by
	Frederic Devernay <Frederic.Devernay@sophia.inria.fr>, by
	including chart-app.h, and thus config.h, before any other header
	files.

2001-06-27  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* prefs.c (prefs_apply): Add call to gtk_widget_queue_draw() after
	preferences get changed.  This will clear or draw tick marks
	immediately after toggling the ticks setting, rather than delaying
	until the next update.

	* strip.c (strip_expose): Call strip_overlay_indicators() when
	handling an expose event.

2001-06-26  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* chart-app.c (on_show_values): Set text window policy to allow
	auto-shrink so that this window to shrink when parameters are
	deleted from its clist.

2001-06-24  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* chart.c (val2gdk): If computing the vertical position of a value
	results in not-a-number, return zero rather than -inf.  This
	corrects the problem of data suddenly jumping to the top of the
	strip when their values get very small.

	* chart-app.c (chart_app_new): Replace multiple calls to
	strip_set_history_size() to one call to
	strip_set_default_history_size().  Locate this call so that it
	works correctly.

	* strip.c (strip_set_default_history_size): Renamed from
	strip_set_history_size(), to better reflect what it actually does.

Sun Jun 24 16:10:27 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, stripchart-applet.gnorba:  Add a gnorba file so that
	  the applet can actually work

2001-06-24  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* strip.c (strip_indicator_marks): New function used to draw
	indicator blocks both when updating and when shifting the strip.

2001-06-23  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* params.c (param_page_set_from_desc): Move both calls to
	add_color(page) here, since they both immediately proceeded a call
	to param_page_set_from_desc anyway.  Shuffled code around to put
	definitions before calls to avoid forward declarations,
	artificially bloating this diff with code churn.
	(on_option): Add 'do { add_color(page); } while (...);', as is
	done in create_param_page().  This corrects bug #53324.

	* strip.c (strip_update): Redraw the strip to erase any tick marks
	when first turning off tick marks.
	(strip_redraw): Move the indicator position initializations
	outside of the indicator drawing loop so that more than a single
	indicator can be displayed.

	* stripchart.params: Add a description and a color to the "Custom"
	(empty) parameter.  This corrects bug #52789.

	* params.c (help_menu_uiinfo): Eliminate a lurking remnant of the
	transition from gstripchart: change the name of the help files in
	the GNOMEUIINFO_HELP macro from "gstripchart" to "stripchart".
	(on_save): Don't try to hide the file selector unless the file
	selector actually exists.  This eliminates a warning when saving a
	configuration file.

	* gnome-utils 1.4.0.1, the "Badger spleens" release was announced
	today.  Too bad I didn't get today's batch of changes in earlier.

2001-06-21  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* params.c (opts_to_file): Don't try to save parameters that have
	been deleted.  This corrects bugs #55604 and #56415.

2001-06-05  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* stripchart-applet.desktop: Added sv translation.

2001-06-04  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* Comment out trailing stuff after #endif.
	
2001-04-25  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* params.c: Fix bug #52289: Replace C++ comments with C.

	* prefs.c: Here too.

2001-04-07  Manuel de Vega Barreiro <mbarreiro@red.madritel.es>

        New Spanish Translations

        * stripchart/doc/es
        * stripchart/doc/Makefile.am

2001-03-10  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* eval.c (num_op): Correct evaluation of time ($t) and delta-time
	(~t) values.

	* chart.c (chart_parameter_add): Default to an unlimited range of
	allowable adjustment for parameters.

2001-03-07  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* params.c (param_desc_ingest): If a parameter file is missing or
	invalid, only complain about it once.

	* eval.c (num_op): Correct time values: $t is time since startup,
	and ~t is the delta time between evaluation iterations.

	* stripchart.params: Add mail, ppp parameters.

	* stripchart.conf: Add parameter to monitor e-mail; add
	description to Busy parameter.

	* params.c (on_color_set): Insure that a parameter datum actually
	exists before attempting to set its color, thus avoiding an
	embarrassing seg fault.

2001-02-24 - John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* adding <figure> tags to screenshots in stripchart.sgml to avoid
	annoying segfault in gnome-db2htm2

2001-01-21  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* Initial checkin to the Gnome CVS repository.
