- Handle setting of bot_{min,max} from the parameter editor.  Figure
  out how to handle these, particularly when using logarithmic scaling
  and negative values.

- Add a floating point error handler to catch divide-by-zero and other
  value-dependant evaluation errors. 

- Add novice/expert mode.  Don't scare off the novices by showing the
  equation, filename, and pattern fields.

- Move "Apply" from Edit menu onto a push button on each parameter page.

- Load all parameter files found in a directory.


- As per Jeff Stern, add a time-display tooltip.

- Display parameter legend, scale lines, etc.

- Add $stat and ~stat to hold file status values.

- Consider only opening a file once, and perhaps resetting it before
  each read.  The FD could go into the eval struct, and may be needed
  for $stat anyway.

- Add a linear-step autorange function.

- When resizing a strip, redraw immediately if the range has changed.
  Currently this is delayed until the strip redraw for the next timer
  tick.


- Consider replacing gnome-xml with glib markup.

- Replace the Linux-specific code for aggregate network traffic with
  something based on the libgtop code.  This will require a version of
  the libgtop code which is newer than the 1.07 version released with
  gnome-1.2.

- Find a way to monitor the performance parameters of systems other
  that the local host.  This would most likely involve using a
  network-enabled version of libgtop, and cooking up some syntax for
  including a host spec in the equations.


- Library-ize all the common object files.

- Check naming conventions, etc.
