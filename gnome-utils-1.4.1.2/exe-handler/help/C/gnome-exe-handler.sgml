    <title>GNOME-exe-handler</title>
    <para>The <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> is a small utility
      used by other applications to launch programs inside the
    <acronym>GNOME</acronym> environment. It checks to see if a file is
    executable, then prompts users to be sure they want to run it before
    executing the file. While it can be invoked directly from
    the command line, it is more likely to have been invoked by another program,
      often the <application>Nautilus</application> file manager, by
    double-clicking on a file name or icon.
    </para>

    <para>Typically, <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> will be invoked
    for the execution of a binary file in a case where the file's permissions
    have not been set to allow user execution. The
    <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> will first try to determine the
    type of file. If it appears to be executable, it will then prompt the user to
    determine whether the user wants to start the program, then change the
    permissions to allow the program to be executed.

      <warning>
	<para>Executing arbitrary programs that you download from the Internet
	can be dangerous. Be sure you understand what a program is before you
	  permit <application>gnome-exe-handler</application> to execute it.</para>
