    <para>
      <application>Gshutdown</application> is a program for shutting
      down your computer. It is included in the package
      <filename>GNOME-utils</filename>, which is a
      part of the GNOME desktop environment. This document describes
      version &version; of <application>Gshutdown</application>.
    </para>

    <para><application>Gshutdown</application> can be started by
      selecting <guimenuitem>Shut Down or Reboot</guimenuitem> from
      <guisubmenu>System</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
	Menu</guimenu>, or by running the command
      <command>gshutdown</command> on the command line. Gshutdown is
      intended for use by system administrators, and must be run with
      root authority.

      </para>

 <para> This is the Gnome shutdown window.  If you want to turn your
      computer off, choose "Shut Down" rather than "Reboot," then
      press "OK." Wait a few moments for your computer to prepare
      itself, then turn it off. If you see the line "System Halted,"
      it's safe to power down the system.  If your computer has
      Advanced Power Management support, like many laptops and some
      desktops, you may not need the power button.</para>

      <para> To reboot, just choose "Reboot," press "OK," and wait.</para>

  <para>Using the Advanced tab, you can change to any
      runlevel.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>runlevel</emphasis> is a software
       configuration of the system which allows  only  a selected
       group of processes to exist.  The processes spawned by
       <application>init</application> for each of these runlevels
       are defined  in  the <filename>/etc/inittab
       file</filename>. Init can be in one of eight runlevels: 0-6 and
       S or s.</para>

      <para>Runlevels 0, 1, and 6 are reserved. Runlevel 0 is used to
       halt the system, runlevel 6 is used to reboot the  system,
       and  runlevel 1 is used to get the system down into single
       user mode. Runlevel S is  not  really  meant  to  be  used
       directly,  but more for the scripts that are executed when
       entering runlevel 1.</para>

      <para>More information on runlevels is available in the
	<ulink url="man:init"><application>init</application> manual page</ulink>.</para>

      <para> There is also a preferences dialog which allows you to
      configure the shutdown command line. For details of runlevels
      and the effect of various command line shutdown instructions,
      see your computer's documentation. If you are unfamiliar with
      the details of these issues, you
      should stick to the Easy tab. If you do know these things, the
      Advanced tab should be self-explanatory.</para>
