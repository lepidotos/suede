	* src/interface.c: s/gdk_colormap_get_system()/gtk_widget_get_colormap()
	
2001-08-08  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* \*.desktop: Added zh_TW.Big5 (traditional Chinese) strings.

Fri Jun 29 22:42:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/asciiselect.c, src/interface.c: 1) mark fonts for translations,
	  2) handle NULL errors by just using the default gtk font in that
	  case

Fri Jun 29 22:14:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/asciiselect.c: update the spin button before inserting,
	  fixes bug #51613

Sun Jun 24 19:25:40 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/asciiselect.c: Fixed keyboard foo in the asciiselector dialog,
	  and wipe the OK button, it made no sense, you can just click
	  insert/close to get the same effect with less confusing semantics

Sun Jun 24 19:02:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* src/interface.c, src/callbacks.c:  Wipe the 0 char as it's not
	  printable, "del" now actually works as a "del", perhaps it should
	  just be removed though.  Also pad the statusbar text with a space
	  to make it more readable.

2001-06-22  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* src/main.c: Use "gcharmap" instead of PACKAGE in gnome-init().
	
2001-06-05  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* src/asciselect.c, callbacks.c, menus.c: Use Character code instead
	of ASCII code since ASCII only covers 7-bits.
	* src/*.*: Fix i18n brokenness by including <config.h> at the top
	of all .c files. Also shuffle the headers a bit. Finally make the
	"help" button work by passing the app name instead of PACKAGE as
	the path to the helpfile. Thanks #gnome.
	
2001-06-04  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* src/*.*: Comment out stuff after #endif to get rid of warnings.
	
2001-03-11  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	This is the patch from Vlad Harchev <hvv@hippo.ru>:
	
	* src/interface.c: Use locale-specific fonts instead of adobe family,
	which is iso-8859-1 only. Use gtk-theme's font for gnome font picker,
	and compute colors for drawing the characters according to the theme.
	
2001-02-20 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* minor updates to gcharmap.sgml for 1.4 release

	* gcharmap.desktop, pixmaps/Makefile.am:  Patch from Dean Scott
	  <drscott12@hotmail.com> to use the big xpm as the icon as the

2000-09-26  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	iso8859-1 

Tue Sep 05 23:33:21 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  redundant prototypes, make prototypes include (void), removed
	  #ifdef guards in .c files, removed extra arguments to #endif,
	  fixup some errors in #ifdef .h guards.  actually use the includes
	  in main.c.  In asciiselect.c made the spin button update all the
	  time and react to enter by clicking on the default button.  Fix
	  a couple of memleaks.  Made translation of fonts possible and use
	  gdk_fontset_load, and don't hardcode to iso8859-1.  On main page
	  bind activate on the entry to the default button (copy).
