November the 12th, version 1.2.1:
* Completely rewritten gcharmap.
  The code is *very* clean now ;-)
* Improved user interface.
* More customizeable.


May the 1st, version 0.2.0:
* When the window is resized, the character buttons will be resized too.
* The user can now select any ASCII character by entering the ASCII value.
  This feature can be found in the Edit menu.
* Gnome Character Map is now more portable, because it completely depends
  on GTK+, GLib and Gnome libraries and doesn't use any ANSI C or POSIX
  functions.
* Changed the directory structure to follow the GNU standard.
* Finally wrote the autoconf and automake stuff by myself.
  The configure script and Makefiles should be more stable now.
* Some minor changes and bugfixes.


April the 23, version 0.1.4:
* First public release.
