# Database with description of text messages in english. The idea
# of separating tags from descriptions is useful for translations
# (good idea miguel!)
#
# Format is very simple:
#
#   [tag]:[description]
#
# No need to explain. Caveat: for now the ':' can't be used as part of
# the tag (but it can be used in the message). Another thing: the
# description cannot have '\n'. I'll remove this restriction later.
#
