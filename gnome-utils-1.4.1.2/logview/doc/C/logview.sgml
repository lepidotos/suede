  <title>Introduction</title>
 
    <para>
      <application>logview</application> is a graphical, menu-driven
      viewer that you can use to view and monitor your system
      logs. <application>Logview</application> comes with a few utilities to help you
      manage your logs, including a calendar, log monitor and log statistics
      display.  For some of the most common log entries,
      <application>logview</application> also displays a short description
      of what the log entry means. 
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>Logview</application> is useful if you are new to system
      administration because it provides an easier, more user-friendly
      display of your logs than a
      text display of the log file. It is also useful for more
      experienced administrators, as it contains a calendar to help you
      locate trends and track problems, as well as a monitor to enable you
      to continuously monitor crucial logs.
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>Logview</application> is useful only to those who have
      access to the system log files, which generally requires root access.
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>Logview</application> is contained in the
      <filename>gnome-utils</filename> package, which is part of the GNOME
      desktop environment. This document describes version 0.2 of
      <application>logview</application>.
    </para>

    <para>
      To run <application>logview</application>, assume root status with
      <command>su</command>, then start <application>logview</application>
      from the shell prompt  with the command: <command>logview</command>.
      Alternatively, if you are running your X session as root, you can
      open <application>logview</application> from the <guimenu>Main
	Menu</guimenu>, <guisubmenu>Programs</guisubmenu>,
      <guisubmenu>System</guisubmenu>, <guimenuitem>System log
	monitor</guimenuitem>.

      <title>Syslogd</title>

   
      <para>
	Unix systems record all kinds of system activity in logs. Logs are
	particularly useful to the system administrator for discovering
	intruders, tracking down problems, and improving efficiency of the
	system. Syslogd, the system log daemon, monitors system activity
	looking for loggable events. When syslogd discovers an event that
	should be logged, it puts it in the correct log file. Some messages,
	such as kernel messages, are immediately printed to the screen, while
	others are mailed to root. Syslogd quietly places routine messages in
	the appropriate log file, to wait for the system administrator to open
	the log file and read the messages.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="syslog.conf"> 
      <title>Syslogd Configuration</title>
      <para>
	Syslogd's behavior is determined by the syslog configuration file
	<filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>. <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> lists the
	kinds of events which should be logged, and the file where each event
	should be placed. There are two parts to an
	<filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> entry: the facility, which lists
	the process that involves the event, and the severity, which gives
	different instructions for the logging of the event, depending on its
	severity. A sample <filename>syslog.conf</filename> file is shown below:
      </para>

      <programlisting>
# Log all kernel messages to the console.
# Logging much else clutters up the screen.
#kern.*							/dev/console

# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none				/var/log/messages

# The authpriv file has restricted access.
authpriv.*						/var/log/secure

# Log all the mail messages in one place.
mail.*							/var/log/maillog

# Everybody gets emergency messages, plus log them on another
# machine.
*.emerg							*
 # Save mail and news errors of level err and higher in a
# special file.

<para>
When you first start <application>logview</application>, it opens to
<filename>/var/log/messages</filename> by default. The
<interface>Open</interface> dialog box automatically displays the
<filename>/var/log</filename> directory. You can open as many logs
simultaneously as you want, but only one log appears in the
<application>logview</application> window at a time.

<para>
To display each open log in turn, press the <keysym>+</keysym> key to
	scroll forwards through your logs in the order that you
	opened them, and the <keysym>-</keysym> key to scroll
	backwards. Use either
	the scrollbar in the <application>logview</application> window
	or  the <keysym>PageDn</keysym> and <keysym>PageUp</keysym>
	keys to scroll through the entries of a log.

    <para>
      The logstats tool displays basic statistics about the log, including
      the log full pathname, the size of the log file in bytes, the date
      the log was last modified, the date the log was started, the date of

    <para>
      Zoom opens a window with detailed information on the selected log
      entry. For some of the more common log entries, the zoom window also
      contains a description of what the log entry means. The zoom window
