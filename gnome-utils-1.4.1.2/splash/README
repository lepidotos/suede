Splash renders splash screens for installers and other
non GUI aware application code. If invoked from a  non
X11 environment it remains silent but runs the client
code. It displays the selected xpm images centered on
the display and shaped according to the mask of the xpm
(if you want to no shape use no mask..)

Execution

	splash logoscreen.xpm program-or-script

Within the script

	splac -title string

Sets the window title for the logo

	splac -image new.xpm

Changes the image. The new image need not be the same size.
