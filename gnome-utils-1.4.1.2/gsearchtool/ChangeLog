Thu Jun 07 14:40:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  for separating entries and make it start the search on enter

2001-06-07  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* outdlg.c: Mark a string for translation.
	
Thu Apr 19 13:49:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

2000-01-02 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* mv help/es/gsearch.sgml to gsearchtool.sgml, add topic.dat, and
	needed .png files for working es docs

2001-01-02 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* mv help/it/gsearch.sgml to help/it/gsearchtool.sgml (to match
	Nautilus help file naming convention) updating Makefile.am to match
	
2000-12-26 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* mv help/C/gsearch.sgml to help/C/gsearchtool.sgml - name of
	*.sgml file needs to = name of share/gnome/help directory for
	Nautilus to recognize it. Updated help/C/Makefile.am to accomodate
	the change

2000-10-17  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* help/C/gsearch.sgml: updated links, legalinfo, license for GNOME
	1.4; added "manual" to the title.

Sun Sep 10 15:08:51 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gsearchtool.c: fix buffer overflow by using GString.  Also make
	  the running flag an enum.

2000-06-28 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>
	* updating version number in gsearch.sgml

Tue Jun 06 15:31:30 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gsearchtool.c: use the -0 and -Z and other tricks to make this
	  work correctly for weird filenames.  The downside is it won't
	  work on non-GNU versions of find, grep and xarg, but it's really
	  unsafe if arbitrary things can be passed to programs.  Also add
	  a dialog box to display the command used.

Tue Jun  6 12:09:56 EDT 2000 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* help/* : Lots of loving going on so the documentation 
	people will be happy with the result and I don't have much pain
	to go through to maintain this mess.
 	Anyway.. Documentation generation should be perfect now, providing
	you have the voodoo that they call docbook installed. If not fear
	not young warrior. We copy the generated stuff into the dist so
	only the maintainer has to pull hair getting docbook set up 
	correctly.

2000-04-22  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* gsearchtool.desktop : Added [tr] .

Mon Mar 27 16:55:40 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gsearchtool.c: pack the find and grep boxes in with no expanding
	  so that removing looks saner, also leave the default window policy,
	  also stop the commands on window close/quit.  Also make start
	  button unsensitive during run

2000-03-26  Karl EICHWALDER  <ke@suse.de>

	* gsearchtool.c (create_locate_page): Add missing dot.

2000-03-24  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

Sat Feb 12 22:47:05 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gsearchtool.c,outdlg.c: call gtk_widget_ensure_style so that
	  the widget gets the style set so that our list adding function
	  gets the correct font.  Also use gtk_window_set_default_size
	  instead of set_usize on the clist and allow the dialog to be
	  resized

Mon Feb 07 14:52:28 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* help/C/*: added online help from Alexander Kirillov
	  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	  text fields, use gnome_file_entry for the start directory entry

Mon Nov 29 22:47:21 1999  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gsearchtool.c: applied patch from Martin Oberzalek
	  <oberzalek@chello.at> and modified it to be a bit saner.  It gets
	  and prints out the errors into a dialog box

1999-08-15  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* gnome-searchtool.png: Icon by Ben Frantzdale.

	* outdlg.[ch]: use gnome dialog and clist

Mon Jun 08 07:38:45 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gsearchtool.c: new interface work, but it's still
	  all #if 0'ed out.  this seems like it will be a complete
	  rewrite after all

Tue May 26 02:05:35 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gsearchtool.[ch]: a lot of interface work, but almost
	  no functionality yet on the new front end, so it's still
	  #if 0'ed out and the old one is still in there

Mon May 25 02:21:04 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gsearchtool.[ch]: a little bit of work on teh new
