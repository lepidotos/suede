    <P
> In addition to the simple filename search described above,
      the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Search Tool</TT
> allows you to
      specify other criteria. To do so, you should select the
      appropriate criteria type from the drop-down list (located to
      the left of the <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Add</B
> button), and press
      <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Add</B
>. This will add this criterion to the
      already existing ones. <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Search
      Tool</TT
> will search for files meeting
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>all</I
> of the specified criteria. For example,
       shows search for all files with
      extension <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>txt</TT
> which were modified during
      the last 7 days and which contain the word GNOME.

    <P

      pressing <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Remove</B

      temporarily disable a criterion by unchecking the
      <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"

      Below is the list of all possible criteria types: 
      <P
></P
><UL
>	<LI
><P
> 
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Filename</I
>   search by filename. As
	    usual, you can use the wildcards * and ? in the
	    search. Remember also that UNIX file names are
	    case-sensitive. 
	</P
></LI
>

	<LI
>          <P
> <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Don't search subdirectories</I
>
            if this option is selected, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME
           Search Tool</TT
> will not search the files in the
           subdirectories of the start directory.  
	  </P
>
	</LI
>

	<LI
><P
> 
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>File owner</I
>   search by the name of
	    the user owning the file.
	</P
></LI
>

	<LI
><P
> 
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>File owner group</I
>   search by the name
	    of the group owning the file. 
	</P
></LI
>

	<LI
><P
> 
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Last modification time</I
>   search for
	    files which were modified during the last N days (to be
	    precise, during the last N*24 hours).  
	</P
></LI
>

	<LI
><P
> <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Don't search mounted
	  filesystems</I
>  if this option is selected,
	  <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Search Tool</TT
> will only
	  search in the subdirectories which are mounted on the same
	  device (disk) as the starting directory. For example, if the
	  starting directory is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
> and is mounted
	  on <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda</TT
> (first hard drive), and it
	  has a subdirectory <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
> which is
	  mounted on <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdb</TT
> (second hard
	  drive), then <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
> will not be
	  searched. This option can be useful to exclude files on the
	  removable media (CD-ROM, floppy) from the search.
	  </P
></LI
>

	<LI
>	  <P
> <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Empty file</I
>  this criterion
	    matches the empty file. Mostly used by system
	    administrators for system maintenance.  
	  </P
></LI
>

	<LI
><P
> 
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Invalid user or group</I
>  matches files
	    whose owner or group is not known to the system. This
	    option can be useful when searching for files belonging to
	    users who have been removed from the system. Mostly used
	    by system administrators for system maintenance.   
	</P
></LI
>

	<LI
>	  <P
> 
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Filenames except</I
> 
	    matches all files except those whose filename is given. As
	    before, you can use wildcards. For example, if you specify
	    in this field <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>*~</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME
	    Search Tool</TT
> will exclude from the search all
	    files with names ending with tilde (~).
	  </P
>
	</LI
>

	<LI
><P
> 
            <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Simple substring search</I
>
	     matches all files that
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>contain</I
> given substring. Since this
	    option involves reading contents of every file, it can
	    slow down the search significantly. Note: you can't use
	    wildcards with this option.  
	  </P
></LI
>

	<LI
><P
> <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Regular expression
	  search</I
>  matches all files that
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>contain</I
> given regular expression.
	  Since this option involves reading contents of every file,
	  it can slow down the search significantly.
	  </P
></LI
>

	<LI
>	  <P
> 
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Extended regular expression
	      search</I
>  matches all files that
	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>contain</I
> given extended regular
	    expression. Since this option involves reading contents of
	    every file, it can slow down the search significantly.
          </P

      For those unfamiliar with the notion of regular expression, let
      us just say that this is an extremely flexible and powerful
      syntax for pattern matching. Unlike simple wildcard matching, it
      allows logical operations (and, or, not), lists of symbols to
      match, checking for a string in the beginning of the line, and
      much more. Detailed description of regular expressions and
      extended regular expressions can be found in the man page for
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>grep</TT
>. New users will probably find it too
      complicated to use, but for more experienced users, regular
      expressions can be very useful.
