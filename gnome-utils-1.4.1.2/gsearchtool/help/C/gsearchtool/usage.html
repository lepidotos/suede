    <P

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Search Tool</TT
> provides two types of
    search: <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Full find</I
> and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Quick
    find</I
>. Full find is reliable and provides many
    possibilities, but can be slow. Quick find uses special technique
    for speeding up search; it is much faster, but can only search by
    filename, and is not as accurate as full find. This section
    describes full find mode; quick find is described in .

    <P
> 
      To start a search, you must give the GNOME Search Tool the
      search criteria and the directory to start in. 
    </P
> 

   <P
> By default, the search starts in the current working
      directory; if the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Search Tool</TT
>
      was started from the menu, then the current working directory is
      your home directory. You can change the starting directory by
      entering any valid path in the <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Start in
      directory</B
></TT
> field, or by choosing a directory using the
      <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Browse...</B
> button. For example, to search
      through all the files in on your system, enter
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
> in this field (warning: it will take
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
> very</I
> long time).  </P
>

   <P
> By default, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Search Tool</TT
>
      also searches through all subdirectories of the given directory;
      you can turn this behavior off by enabling the option
      <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Don't search subdirectories</B
></TT
>. For finer
      control, you can enable the option <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Don't search
      mounted filesystems</B
></TT
>, which will exclude from the
      search subdirectories which are physically located (mounted) on
      drives or partitions other than the starting directory 
      see  for details.
    </P
>

   <P
> 
      The only search criterion presented by default is the
      <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Filename</B
></TT
>. You can use the wildcards
      <SPAN
CLASS="KEYSYM"
>*</SPAN
> 
      (matches any sequence of symbols, including an empty one) and
      <SPAN
CLASS="KEYSYM"
>?</SPAN
> 
      (matches any single symbol) in this field. For example, to find
      the files with the extension <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>txt</TT
>, enter
      <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>*.txt</B
></TT
> in this field; to find all the
      files that start with the letter D, enter
      <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>D*</B
></TT
> (warning: file names are
      case-sensitive!).  You can also specify much more complicated
      search criteria  see .
   </P
>
   
   <P
> After you have specified the search criteria and starting
   directory, press <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Start</B
>. This will take some
   time (depending on the directory size and system speed), after
   which you will be presented with a window containing the list of
   all the files matching your criteria (it may be empty), as shown in
   . If the search is taking too much time,
   you can abort it by pressing <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Stop</B
> button.

   <P
> In the search results window, you can double-click on any
      file to open it. It will have the same effect as double-clicking
      on this file in a File Manager window  that is, the file
      will be opened using the default action for this file type. You
      can also save the list of found files  to disk by pressing
      <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Save</B
> button. You will be prompted for a
      filename to save the list to; the list will be saved in a plain
      text format.
