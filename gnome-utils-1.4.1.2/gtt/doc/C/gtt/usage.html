> <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Time Tracker</TT
> can be
    used to keep track of the amount of time you spend on different
    things you do.  You do this by defining several projects
    and then, as you go through the day, telling
    <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Time Tracker</TT
> which
    project you're working on.  It will tell you how much time you spend
    on each project each day, the total time spent on each project,
    and the amount of time logged on all projects each day.
    </P
><P
>      Unfortunately, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Time Tracker</TT
> 
      isn't particularly smart: it won't turn the timer off for you if you 
      take a break for a quick game of solitaire and it turns into several hours of distraction.
      The inactivity timer will notice that you are still using the keyboard and mouse;
      it does not know that its just solitaire.
      When you stop work on a project, be sure to turn off
      the timer by clicking the <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Timer</B
> button or using <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>      Stop</B
> from the <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Timer</B
> menu.  As long as you remember to do 
      this, your work will be recorded effectively.  You can, however, alter the times from the
      <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Properties</SPAN
> dialog if they are incorrect.  See <A
HREF="dialogs.html#PROPERTIES"
></A
> for more information.
    </P
><P
><TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Time Tracker</TT
> can inform you about your
      project times in several ways.
      For each project, it maintains a timer for the amount  
      of time you have spent on the project today, this week, this month, this year, 
      and how much time you have spent on it total.
      In addition,<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Time Tracker</TT
> counts how much time you have spent
      on all projects in the current day.  This last figure is the one displayed in the lower left hand
      corner of the status bar.
      </P
><P
>	When you first start <TT

      The main window consists of four areas. There is a menu bar (see <A

></A

      a toolbar (see <A
HREF="usage.html#TOOLBAR"
></A

      a status bar (see <A

 and between the toolbar and the status bar,
      a scrollable project list (see <A
HREF="usage.html#PROJLIST"

      When you start<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"

      show just one project, which is titled "empty".
