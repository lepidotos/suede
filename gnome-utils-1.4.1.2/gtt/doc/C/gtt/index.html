CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Time Tracker</TT
> 
      is a combination stop-watch, diary, to-do list tracker and 
      consultant billing system.  You can measure the amount of time you
      spend on a task, associate a memo with it, set a billing rate, print
      an invoice, as well as track that status of other projects.


      You do not need to learn or use every feature in
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Time Tracker</TT
>
      to be productive: it is meant to be quite usable
      without requiring a deep study of the documentation.
      But once you have learned to use 
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME Time Tracker</TT
>
      effectively, it can be as effective as any desktop organizer.
    </P

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Basic Stop-Watch Support</I
>
    At its core, GTT is a fancy stop-watch: you can click on
    an icon to start and stop one of any number of timers.
    It is the times measured by these clocks that make up
    the core data that GTT works with.
          </P

>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Project Planning Support</I
>
    Well, OK, "project planning" may be an overstatment.  But GTT
    does provide basic to-do list support, including the ability
    to rank by importance and urgency, specify expected start/stop
    times, state the project status, and estimate the amount of
    time needed to complete the project.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Basic Billing/Invoicing Support</I
>
    Infrastructure for storing price &#38; billing information has been
     put into place.  This allows billing invoices to be generated.
     Tasks can be marked as billable, non-billable, on-hold, or
     free-of-charge. Billing rates for regular, overtime,
     double-overtime or flat-fee can be set per task.
     (Fancier-looking invoices still needed).
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Sub-Project Support</I
>
    New projects can be listed
     as sub-projects of other projects.  The time totals will show
     the total including sub-projects.  The Hierarchical tree can be
     expanded / collapsed to simplify viewing.  The tree can be
     re-arranged by dragging-n-dropping projects.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Simpler Navigation</I
>
    Arrow keys and carriage return now work in the main window.
     Up/down keys can be used to move up &#38; down.  The left/right arrow
     keys expand/collapse a sub-project list.  Hitting return selects
     the project.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Log Journal</I
>
    A journal showing explicit start and stop times is maintained.
     Blocks of time can be annotated with memos.  The journal can be
     exported as an html page, or printed (OK, printer support not
     yet finished).
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Auto-merge/cleanup of Short Intervals Support</I
>
    Extremely short
     intervals (the length is configurable) are automatically removed
     from the logs.  Slightly longer but still short intervals
     are auto-merged into nearby neighbors. Short gaps between intervals
     are coalesced as well.  You can specify a time period of 0 seconds
     to turn these features off.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>HTML-based GUI</I
>
    The journal GUI is based on extended html pages.  If you know
     HTML, then you can create customized report pages.  Particularly
     handy for slapping the company logo and mailing address on the top
     of the page, and generating a unique, custom look.
     User-defined reports (contained in ghtml files) can be added to the
     menus by typing in the filename into the 'new report' GUI dialog.
     Typically, a 'user-defined report' is one with customized layout,
     maybe a logo added, all-spiffed up &#38; such.
          </P

>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Inactivity Timeout</I
>
    An inactivity timeout has been implemented. If the keyboard
     or mouse have been idle for more than some period of time, then
     the clock is stopped.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Shell Commands</I
>
    A shell command can be executed whenever a project timer is
    started or stopped.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Scheme Extension Language</I
>
    Scheme (guile) is used as an extension language, although scheme
     support is currently limited to report generation.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>XML File Format</I
>
    All project and journal data are stored in an XML file format.
    This should simplify future interoperability and data access concerns.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Multi-Language Support</I
>
    The basic GTT menus have been translated to dozens of languages.
    Translations are need for the manual. (Actually, the manual needs
    a re-write).
