1.1 OVERVIEW 

gdict is a small C/GTK+ program written to find definitions of
arbitrary words. It contacts any RFC 2229-compliant dictionary server
and returns a definition.

Also, starting from version 0.7, I have included 'dict', a console
version of gdict. It behaves in the same way, except it outputs to
stdout. It gets installed along with gdict. (Note (hovinen): the
command line version is currently out of date and is not included with
gnome-utils)

1.2 INSTALLATION

First, read the ChangeLog file!  See INSTALL for further details.  In
short, you should be fine with:
    ./configure
    make
    make install

By default, printing support is not compiled in.  If you want to try it
out, then you need libgnomeprint version 0.4 or higher installed on your
system.  You must also use the --enable-gnome-print option, eg:
    ./configure --enable-gnome-print


1.3 USAGE

Enter a word in the top field and press the "Lookup" button.  The
definition will show up in the text field below.  You can copy this text
to the clipboard.

Or, you can start gdict on the command line with the following syntax:

$ gdict word

Where "word" is the word you want to define.  The definition will pop up
when the application starts.

Also, with the -a (or --applet) option, gdict will appear on the GNOME
panel, for easy access.

The same applies to the dict program that is bundled with version 0.7 and
above.  The syntax is like this from the command line:

$ dict word
