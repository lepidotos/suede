* Add support for other file system types, when they are available,
  such as Minix when mkfs.minix is available and executable.

* FAT32 support for DOS bootdisks (nobody wants truncated file names
  on their floppies).

* Perhaps some kind of su ability, so regular users can format without
  playing with the permissions of /dev/fd0.

* Configurable devices to format (currently hard coded to /dev/fd0).

* Perhaps a toggle option for "System" or "Bootable" disk?  I'm not
  sure I even know how to make a floppy that I can boot to off the top
  of my head, a regular user/former windows user might like something
  like this.
