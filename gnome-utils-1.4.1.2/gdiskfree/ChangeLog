	* gdiskfree_options.c: minor cleanup

Sun Aug 12 13:27:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdiskfree_options.c:  Fix initialization of the excludes list to
	  NULL to avoid segv

2001-08-12  Gregory McLean <gregm@gxsnmp.org>
	* gdiskfree_options.c/h : Move the excluded filesystems list 
	to the application's option structure for the upcomming user
	configurable exclude fs stuff.
	* gdiskfree.c : switch to use the app config structure for the 
	excluded filesystems.
        Need to figure out how to write a list using the gnome_config<blah>
 	stuff..

2001-08-10  Matthias Warkus  <mawarkus@gnome.org>

	* *.png: Icon and splash logo by Timothy Musson
	<trmusson@ihug.co.nz> added, with permission of the maintainer.
	
	* Makefile.am: Install pixmaps.

	* gdiskfree.desktop: Use new icon.
	
	* gdiskfree_menus.c: Use splash pixmap.
	

2001-08-08  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* \*.desktop: Added zh_TW.Big5 (traditional Chinese) strings.

Wed Jun 06 16:22:15 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdiskfree_app.c: When percentage is over 100% just trim to 100%.
	  You can't show more then 100% with gtk-dial anyhow.  Use current
	  options rather then always reading from config since that's the
	  only way the defaults will work.  When the stored location is off
	  screen make sure at least 50 pixels are showing on screen.  Also
	  allow saving at 0,0 location, this should really be done by the
	  session manager.

	* gdiskfree.c: don't crash on VERY large disks (currently over
	  1000Tb) and it fixes a warning as well.

	* gdiskfree_options.c: make show_mount and show_size default to on,
	  since most users will have NO clue about the mount point and size
	  and that's the important information we care about.  Also sanitize
	  things.  Make the lowest update time 300, since that's basically
	  about the lowest useful time where the CPU isn't hogged.

2001-06-06  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* gdiskfree.c (main): Use "gdiskfree" instead of PACKAGE in
	gnome_init_with_popt_table(). Also exclude "usbdevfs".
	
2001-06-05  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* gdiskfree.desktop: Modified sv translation.

2001-06-03 Gregory McLean <gregm@gxsnmp.org>

	* gdiskfree_app.c - gdiskfree_app_change_orient, added some code
	to fix one of my personal annoyances, now when we change orientation
	of the app we re-size the window like it should have all along.
        Plus the user can still re-size the window as he/she sees fit. The
	magical resize is only triggered on oreintation change (and probably
	on drive add/remove but thats later)

	* gdiskfree_options.c - link help into help button on preferences
	dialog - fixes bugzilla #16631
