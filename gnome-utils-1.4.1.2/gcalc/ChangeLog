2001-09-30  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gnome-calc.c: (display_expose), (create_button): Fixed 
          buttons so that they expand/contract vertically. Fixed display

	  this should be using Pango for 2.0 :)

	* Makefile.am, sr.[ch], gcalc.c: Added X11R3 xcalc -analog slide
	  rule mode, courtesy Jamie Zawinski <jwz@jwz.org>, (well it's
	  mostly the original xcalc code, so it kind of sucks, needs
	  to be ported to GTK+ and made not to not suck)

Sun Jun 24 18:12:25 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-calc.c: Delete does CE/E, generalize INV creation a bit more,

	backported it form GTK+2 (ifdef the two builds)
	s/GnomeCalculator/GnomeCalc/g
	s/gnome_calculator_/gnome_calc_/g
	since we don't want to clash with the symbols in libgnomeui
	(backspace_cb): implement
	(key_press_event_cb): ditto
	(gnome_calc_bind_extra_keys): ditto

	* gnome-calc.h: ditto, add the header for _bind_extra_keys
