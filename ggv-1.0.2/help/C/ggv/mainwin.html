>    	 Every document has a main window.
The main window consists of a menu bar, 
		a scrolling pane, buttons for zooming and navigating
                between pages, a list of pages and finally the main
                view of the PostScript document.

>Main View. The main view displays the document page. If
	the monitor is large enough or if the page is small enough,
	the view will display the entire page, otherwise you will only
	section of it. In the sake of simplicity, we will refer to the
	main view as the view.
	</P
></LI

>Scrolling pane.  The scrolling pane is the rectangular
	area at the top left corner of GGv. The scrolling pane is a
	visual representation of the complete page currently displayed
	in the view. The scrolling pane has an engraved rectangle
	inside. This rectangle is a representation of the current view
	(as displayed by the  view) with regard to the complete
	current page. An example might be the easiest way to
	understand this: load a document, resize GGv to the point that
	you can only see part of the document; look now at the
	scrolling pane. The smaller the window, the smaller the
	engraved rectangle. We will refer to the engraved rectangle as
	the slider. The slider, as it name implies, can be moved
	around. Drag it around, and you will see what I mean. In other
	words, the size of the slider with respect to the scrolling
	pane represents how large is the view with respect to the
	document, and the location of the slider represents the
	location of the view. If the complete page is being displayed
	in the view, then the size of the slider is the same as the
	scrolling pane.

>List of Pages. The list of numbers at the bottom left is
	the list of pages available in the PostScript document.

>		There are several different ways to move: the cursor keys
                can be used to move in the desired direction, the spacebar
                moves in the direction of reading (assuming this is
                left-to-right and top-to-bottom) and backspace moves in the
                inverse direction. One can also move by dragging the scroll
                pane around and, finally and most intuitively, by clicking
                and dragging the text itself in the PostScript view.
	</P
><P
>                Clicking in the PostScript pane will pop up a menu, allowing
                you to navigate pages, zoom in or out, recenter the page or
                toggle the visibility of menu bar or the side panel.
        </P

>                It is also possible to drag a list of files from the file
                manager to the GGv window, making GGv load and display them
                in different windows.
        </P
><P
>                From the File menu, you can open a new viewing window, open
                a new document or reload the existing one. You can also close
                the window (which exits GGv if no more windows exist) or exit
                the viewer completely.
        </P

>                The Document menu lets you proceed to the next or previous page,
                recenter the page and set the orientation of the document's pages
                or zoom to one of the preset magnifications.
        </P
><P
>                In Settings menu you can bring up the Preferences dialog or
                toggle the visibility of the menu bar and the side panel of
                the current window.
