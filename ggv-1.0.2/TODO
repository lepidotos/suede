In no particular order

* gdk_pixbuf. Investigate and maybe try to use gdk_pixbuf to speed up
display in slow machines. 

* We are passing any file to gs in the believe that some PS files do
not start with the usual %PS. We should make this more error
secure. For example, ask the user if that is what they wanted, and
report better error messages. The best case is to programmatically
determine what kind of file it is before we send it to gs.

* The page list: When the page is selected with the mouse, it is
surrounded with a black box. This black box is not removed when the
user further moves around with the keyboard (page up, page
down). Update. This is not a ggv error. It is a gtk error.

* Mouse events: implement move for first button steal select code from
ee for middle button.  bring up menu for right button hook up
Coordinates with the real ones Write Preferences Dialog

* Resizing: Currently, it sizes the window to the current size of the
document in 1:1 zoom mode. It should be selectable by the user. 

* zoom support: requires to clean pixmap before zooming. It is not
currently centering the newly created window. 

* zoom page width
* zoom command line support

* zoom region support

* Ability to watch a file: update whenever file changes

* Size of the default window user configurable

* Option to resize window automatically

* Fix handling PS files with just ^M as the row separator (mac files?)
