  <title>Introduction</title> 

  <para>
    <application>Bug Buddy</application> is a tool which
    will guide you through making a bug report as painlessly as possible.
    You can alter things at any stage, and then either send, save, or
    abandon the resulting report. This document describes
    version &version; of <application>Bug Buddy</application>: note that
    it has changed substantially in appearance from earlier versions.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Big Bug Buddy Changes</title>
   <para>
     <application>Bug Buddy</application> has undergone major changes 
     recently. 
   </para>
   <para>
     The Gnome bugtracking system is moving from the email-based 
     <ulink url="http://bugs.gnome.org/" type="http">debbugs 
     installation</ulink> which it originally used to the web-based
     <ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/" type="http">bugzilla 
     installation</ulink>. This is to help deal with bugs more efficiently.
     This means <application>Bug Buddy</application> has been substantially 
     rewritten to deal with the bugzilla system. It looks very similar in 
     appearance and structure, but be aware that it now talks to bugzillas. 
     Reports will only go to the old debbugs system for GNOME if bugzilla 
     doesn't have a category for the bug. 
   </para>
   <para>
     This also means that <application>Bug Buddy</application> has currently
     lost the ability to send bugs to the KDE and Debian bug-trackers
     directly. Note that you can still save reports for those into a file 
     and then mail the file to those trackers yourself.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
    <application>Bug Buddy</application> can be started in a variety
    of ways:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Open the <guimenu>main GNOME menu</guimenu> and select
      <menuchoice>
       <guimenu>Programs</guimenu>
       <guisubmenu>Utilities</guisubmenu>
       <guimenuitem>Bug Report Tool</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      .
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
      Run <command>bug-buddy</command> at the prompt in a terminal such
      as <application>gnome-terminal</application> or
      <application>xterm</application>.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
      If you are using the <application>GNOME file manager</application>,
      gmc, you can double-click your mouse on a core file to start it.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
      When a GNOME program experiences a bad crash, a <guilabel>crash
      dialogue box</guilabel> is displayed. If <application>Bug Buddy</application>
      is present on the system, then one of the options in the dialogue
      box will be to make a bug-report. Selecting that will lead you
      to a further dialogue box giving you details of the program which
      crashed. Continuing at this stage will invoke <application>Bug Buddy
      </application>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
    <application>Bug Buddy</application> is a very structured program.
    At any stage you can continue forward or head backwards to correct
    earlier details, or you can click the <guibutton>Help button</guibutton>
    to bring up this document. 
  </para>

  <para>
    The aim of all this is to be able to collect all the information
    which a developer will need to reproduce the same problem and be
    able to fix it. Some of the information generated may look a bit
    off-putting, but don't delete it. It will be useful.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="contact-info">
  <title>Contact Information</title>

  <para>
    <application>Bug Buddy</application> first asks for these pieces
    of information, in order to be able to send the report correctly.
    It makes very good guesses so you should be able to skip straight
    ahead. 
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Your name</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       Bug Buddy works this out itself, but if you want to change it you
       can do this here.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Email address</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       Please enter a valid email address for you here.  This is so developers
       can request more information from you, or inform you of a fix for your bug.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Full path of sendmail</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       This allows you to check that Bug Buddy is looking in the right
       place when it tries to send email. You will almost certainly not
       need to change this. 
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

  </variablelist>

 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="debug-info">
  <title>Debugging Information</title>
  <para>
    Bug Buddy asks you to choose between three options: 
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Debug nothing</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       This is the default option. If you did not start
       <application>Bug Buddy</application> following a crash, and
       do not have a core file you want debugged, pick this.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Debug core file</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       If <application>Bug Buddy</application> began because you 
       double-clicked on a file named <filename>core</filename> in the
       file manager, select this. Also select this if you have a core file
       which you know was created as a result of the bug you are reporting.
       An extra box will appear where you can tell it where the core file
       lives.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
      
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Debug crashed application</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       If <application>Bug Buddy</application> began because you said
       yes to "Report a bug" in a dialogue box telling you something had
       crashed, select this. If you do so, you will be prompted for
       two things. These should be filled in ready for you. If they 
       are not:
     </para>
     
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         <guilabel>Binary</guilabel>: In this box you must type the
         name of the program as you would type it at the command-line.
         For example, if the <application>Control Center</application>
         crashed, you would need to type <command>gnomecc</command> here.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         <guilabel>Process ID</guilabel>: In this box you must type
         the process ID or <acronym>PID</acronym>. This will probably
         be available from the original dialogue box where you selected
         "Report a bug". If you have closed that window, you can find it
         by starting the <application>Gnome System Monitor</application> 
         through selecting
          <menuchoice>
           <guimenu>Programs</guimenu>
           <guisubmenu>Utilities</guisubmenu>
           <guimenuitem>System Monitor</guimenuitem>
          </menuchoice>
         or typing <command>gtop</command> at the command line. You
         will find the PID in the left-hand column and the command
         in the right hand column (you may need to scroll right for this
         column to be visible).
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="description">
  <title>Bug Description</title>
  <para>
    The <guilabel>Short subject for the bug report</guilabel> section
    will be used as the "Subject" header of the emailed bug report,
    which will turn into a "Summary" line in Bugzilla. Good subject
    lines are specific and do not just say "Bug" or "It crashed". 
    "Crash when I try to save" or "Forgets my preferences" are much 
    better. Hackers will read these summaries when looking for something 
    they can fix, and clear one-sentence summaries will catch their attention. 
    You must fill this in. If you do not, <application>Bug Buddy</application>
    will tell you to.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Something You Don't Need to Include</title>
   <para>
     One thing you do not need to include is the package name, because
     you are going to select that next.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
    The <guilabel>Full description of the bug</guilabel> section is where
    you describe what you did, what happened, and what you expected to
    happen. You must fill this in, too, or
    <application>Bug Buddy</application> will tell you to. Good things to 
    include:
  </para>
   
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Exact copies of any error messages;
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Your window manager name and version (especially if the bug involves 
      moving things around the screen or mouse focus problems);
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      If you can make it happen in one way, and not in another way,
      include that. If there are two ways to do something (a menu
      selection and a typed command, for example), and only one triggers
      the bug, definitely include that;
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Why you think it is a bug. What should have happened instead?
      Whilst this is obvious for some things, ("It shouldn't crash when
      I try to save the file") it is not obvious for others. Give a
      better way for the program to behave. ("If it can't save the file, 
      it should tell me so that I don't keep editing it without realising 
      I am wasting my effort".)
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Sometimes screenshots can help demonstrate bugs. Please do not send one
      in a Bug Buddy report! But if you have one, mention that you have it,
      so that a bug-fixer who would like to see it can email you about it.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 
  <para>
    If you have any suggestions on what caused it or how to fix it,
    wonderful. If not, don't worry. Just explain what happened. If
    a developer needs more information, s/he can mail you back for
    it. 
  </para>

  <para>
    If you have a (short!) text-file which contains information of use
    you can include it here, too. If you have a small HTML file which
    crashes your editor, or two sets of options for a program where one
    works and the other doesn't, these are the sort of things to include
    here. Just put the name of the file into the <guilabel>Include a 
    text file</guilabel> box at the bottom. 
  </para>

    If this is the first time you have run Bug Buddy, you will see

    the last update. Otherwise it will not appear. 
  </para>
  <para>
    A dialogue box telling you <application>Bug Buddy</application> wants   
    to update its list of information will appear and gives you the option
    to proceed or to say no. It will save this information by default into
    your <filename class=directory>.gnome/Bug Buddy.d/</filename> directory.
    To get this information, it needs to talk to bugzilla, so your net
    connection will have to be up. 
  </para>

    again.
  </para>

  <para> 
    The choices currently are to select <guilabel>All</guilabel> systems,

    <term>Component</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
       The product selected will have one or more components to it.

  <title>Submitting the Report</title>
  <para>
    Once you have finished your report, you can review the report and

    some reason, you can. You can choose from:

      will email the bug report to the bug tracker. You can send
      yourself a copy by clicking the relevant checkbox here. If
      you are submitting the report to an independent bug tracker,
      you will need to fill in the submission address yourself.

      <para>
        Even though the report should end up at bugzilla, you will see
        that the address is for bugs.gnome.org. This is fine. Don't change
        it. It's the staging-post which forwards reports on to bugzilla. 
        If bugzilla has no category for it, then bugs.gnome.org will keep
