>Short subject for the bug report</B

    will be used as the "Subject" header of the emailed bug report,
    which will turn into a "Summary" line in Bugzilla. Good subject
    lines are specific and do not just say "Bug" or "It crashed". 
    "Crash when I try to save" or "Forgets my preferences" are much 
    better. Hackers will read these summaries when looking for something 
    they can fix, and clear one-sentence summaries will catch their attention. 
    You must fill this in. If you do not, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Bug Buddy</TT
>
    will tell you to.

    you describe what you did, what happened, and what you expected to
    happen. You must fill this in, too, or
    <TT

    include:

><UL

>      Exact copies of any error messages;
    </P

><P
>      Your window manager name and version (especially if the bug involves 
      moving things around the screen or mouse focus problems);
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      If you can make it happen in one way, and not in another way,
      include that. If there are two ways to do something (a menu
      selection and a typed command, for example), and only one triggers
      the bug, definitely include that;
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Why you think it is a bug. What should have happened instead?
      Whilst this is obvious for some things, ("It shouldn't crash when
      I try to save the file") it is not obvious for others. Give a
      better way for the program to behave. ("If it can't save the file, 
      it should tell me so that I don't keep editing it without realising 
      I am wasting my effort".)
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Sometimes screenshots can help demonstrate bugs. Please do not send one
      in a Bug Buddy report! But if you have one, mention that you have it,
      so that a bug-fixer who would like to see it can email you about it.
    </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>    If you have any suggestions on what caused it or how to fix it,
    wonderful. If not, don't worry. Just explain what happened. If
    a developer needs more information, s/he can mail you back for
    it. 
  </P
><P
>    If you have a (short!) text-file which contains information of use
    you can include it here, too. If you have a small HTML file which
    crashes your editor, or two sets of options for a program where one
    works and the other doesn't, these are the sort of things to include
    here. Just put the name of the file into the <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Include a 
    text file</B
></TT
> box at the bottom.
