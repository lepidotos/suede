Of course.

So there is more to supporting different BTS's than packages.
Fortunately, there are 2 BTS's in use (well that I know of right now): 
debian (debian, gnome, kde) and bugzilla (mozilla, redhat).  So they
not only have different packages, but differant formats for submitting
bugs.

It gets a little more complicated when you think about system information
(as in, if you are submitting a kde bug report, they don't care which
gnome-core you have installed).  So, in addition to having the packages
list, you need to enable some of this stuff too.

So here are the different problems i have identified:

Problem                        Solution
---------------------------    -----------------------------------------
package listing/other stuff    xml stored format, or something

required system info           gmodule type plugins if necessary, if not
                               it can be stored in the above xml file

different UI's                 some libglade stuff could be done here, 
                               which would be really really cool.  This
                               almost definitely requires the plugin 
                               approach.

So this all adds a bit of complexity and stuff.  Right now I would just
like it to stay pretty simple, but definitely in the future this is
going to happen.
