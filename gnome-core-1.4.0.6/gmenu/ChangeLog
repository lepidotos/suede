2000-02-10  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* tree.c (menu_tree_populate): 
	* edit.c (edit_area_set_to): sync the menu names with the 'new'
	names in the HEAD panel.

	fixes bug #6102

1999-10-19  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@gnu.org>

	* main.c (main): Set the infolabel's horizontal usize to 1 so that
	it does not horribly change its size while browsing menus anymore.
	Also, set the alignment so that it's left justified.  Likewise for
	the directory.

	* gmenu.desktop: Fixed/added [de] translations.

1999-04-07  Michael Fulbright  <msf@majestic.labs.redhat.com>

	* edit.c: hacked to not spit out so many warnings - it
	is creating incomplete dentries by hand and when
	gnome_desktop_entry_destroy() is called, location=NULL and
	we get complaints from GNOME.

	This needs to be addressed in a more complete way in the long term.

1999-03-25  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am (gmenu_SOURCES): Put gmenu.h in the list of sources.

Tue Mar  9 22:12:10 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* tree.c: Add startup dialog to show the progress of reading menus.
	Actually, just to show the program is doing something, since reading
	the menus takes noticeable time on my system.

1999-02-16  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

 	crash when the last item in a submenu was deleted, as reported by
 	djw@wolfman.mit.edu.

1999-02-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* dialogs.c (new_item_pressed_cb):
	(save_pressed_cb): I dont know the code well, but current_path

Mon Feb  8 07:00:15 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.[ch]: Version to 0.99.0, copyright to 1999.

1999-02-07  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* tree.c (tree_set_node): Just set the selection in the ctree.
  	The tree_row_selected callback will take care of the rest.
	(update_tree_highlight): Don't select the row.
	(tree_row_selected): Most of the tree_item_selected code was moved
 	here.
	(tree_item_selected): Call tree_set_node.

	* gmenu.c (main): Connect tree_row_selected to the tree_select_row
 	signal.
	(about_cb): Fixed a segfault.  One-line patch from jwb@cp.net.
  	Thanks!

	* edit.c (edit_area_changed): Don't enable the save button if it's
 	not an editable entry.
	(disable_edit_area): New function.

1999-02-06  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@adam.kaist.ac.kr>

	* gmenu.desktop: Added Korean translation.

1999-01-25  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gmenu.c (main): Some very miniscule UI changes to the ctree.

1999-01-25  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* desktop.c: New file to contain all of the .desktop file
 	saving/loading routines.

	* utils.c: New file to contain all of the little utility routines.
	(basename_n): New function.

	* dnd.c: New file which now contains all of the Drag-N-Drop
 	routines.
	(gmenu_init_dnd): New function.  We no longer manually handle the
 	drag-n-drop, but instead use gtk_clist_set_reorderable() and
 	connect to the "tree_move" signal.
	(tree_moved): Expand a tree if we drop an item into it.

	* save.c: New file which handles everything that happens when the
 	'save' button is pressed.
	(save_desktop_entry_file): New function that handles things much
 	more logically.  Specifically, we now enforce a strict mapping
 	between menu item names and the names of the corresponding
 	.desktop files.  That is, a menu item named "Foo" will be stored
 	in "Foo.desktop".  Doing this greatly simplifies the interface for
 	the average user.  We handle checking for conflicts much better
 	now too.
	(set_ctree_node_data): New function to handle changes to some of a
 	menu item's fields.
	(update_desktop_entry_node): New function.

	* delete.c: New file to handle node/menu item deletion.
 	(delete_desktop_entry_file): New function to delete the
 	desktop file associated with a path.
	(remove_node_cb): New function connect to the remove_node signal
 	on the Ctree.  It handles freeing the Desktop_Data and destroying
 	the file associated with a defunct menu item.  Doing deletion this
 	way makes recursive delete possible.
	(delete_desktop_entry): Use this new function as the entry point
 	to the menu item deletion routines.  It deletes the file
 	associated with a menu item, destroys its CTree nodes, and resets
 	'current_node' if appopriate.
	(delete_recursive_cb): Recursively delete a submenu.

	* tree.c (tree_set_node): New function to be used to set the
 	current node.  It also updates the new current_desktop variable
 	and the edit area.
	(tree_item_collapsed): New callback function.  Set the current
 	node appropriately.
	
	* gmenu.c: Added a "current_desktop" global variable.  Removed all
 	of the drag-n-drop functions and put them in dnd.c.  Renamed
 	"Folder" to "Submenu" everywhere.  Added a "New Item" menu entry.
  	Moved the utility routines to utils.c.  Moved the new_item
 	callback to dialogs.c.  

	(main): Connected to the tree_collapse signal so that we can reset
 	the current node when it is no longer visible.  Use the CTree in
 	BROWSE mode.  Use a pane to separate the CTree from the edit box.
	(about_cb):  Added myself to the authors list.

	Renamed "Folder" to "Submenu" everywhere.

	* edit.c (edit_area_select_name): New function.  This selects the
 	contents of the "Name" GtkEntry widget and gives it focus.  For
 	use after the creation of a new menu item.
	(edit_area_get_filename): Removed.  The filename of the .desktop
 	file is now hidden from the user.  It was confusing and lead to a
 	lot of problems to expose that information.  Besides which, the
 	average user doesn't care, and the users who do can very well use
 	a text-editor to edit the menus.
	(create_edit_area): Removed the filename widgets.  Grab the
 	default on the 'save' button.  This doesn't work though, for some
 	reason.

	* dialogs.c (create_folder): Expand the parent folder.  Use
 	tree_set_node() to set the current node.
	(create_folder_pressed_cb): Renamed from create_folder_pressed.
	(new_item_pressed_cb): New callback function for when the 'new
 	item' toolbar button is pressed.
	(delete_dialog_cb): Use the new delete.c node/menu entry deletion
 	functions.
	(delete_pressed_cb): "Delete this menu entry?" instead of "Delete
 	file?".  Handle recursive deletion of non-empty submenus.

	Most of the item saving functionality has been removed from this
 	file, broken down into more logical functional units, and put into
 	save.c.

	(save_pressed_cb): This function has been completely rewritten to
 	use the new save.c routines.

	Renamed "Folder" to "Submenu" everywhere.

1999-01-21  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* gmenu.c (menu_drag_data_received): Renamed
 	folder_drag_data_received to this.  Now you can drop onto
 	non-folders and have it move the items around.  Check that src !=
 	dest, which was causing badness.

	(toolbar): Added a "New Item" button.
	(new_item_cb): Callback for the "New Item" toolbar button.

	* edit.c (new_edit_area): The default new item name is "New Item"
	(create_edit_area): Ifdef out the 'New' button.  It's useless now,
 	and its placement was always confusing.

	* dialogs.c (create_folder): New function to abstract the folder
 	creation routines away from the callback.

	(save_dialog_cb): Do not leave the .desktop name as
 	"untitled.desktop".  Set a name if the user did not set one.
  	Update the edit area to reflect the new filename.
	(save_dialog_dentry): Don't prompt the user about saving.  That's
 	just obnoxious.

	(save_dialog_dentry): New function to abstract the dentry saving
 	away from the callback, a little bit.
	
	* gmenu.c: Commented out the Properties toolbar item, since it is
 	useless now.

	(drag_data_received): Renamed folder_drag_data_received.  Now you
 	can move items around by dragging and dropping.

1999-01-21  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>
	
	* gmenu.c (main): Initialize support for dropping menu items onto
 	the ctree.
	(possible_drag_item_pressed): Save the GtkCTreeNode being dragged
 	in drop_data.

	(drag_data_get_cb): Handle drops to external apps and to gmenu.

	(folder_drag_data_received): New function to handle drops onto the
 	ctree.  Move a menu item here if the user has write permission, and
	the drop was on a folder.

	* tree.c (tree_item_selected): Always update the edit area when
 	someone clicks on a tree item.

1999-01-18  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* gmenu.c (main):
	s/gtk_ctree_set_reorderable/gtk_clist_set_reorderable/

1999-01-06  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* gmenu.c: Use the gnome-uidefs.h macros.  Change the 'new'
 	accelerator from ^F to ^N to match the standard.

1999-01-06  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* gmenu.c: File/E_xit, not File/_Quit

	for editability. Before it was all or nothing for the system menus.
	* order.c: Use gnome_stock_pixmap_widget_at_size() for antiailiased
	icons.
	* dialogs.c: Remove '!' from dialogs, no need to shout. Tell user
	about incorrect permissions instead of saying they must be root.
	* bump verison to 0.3.1

Sat Sep 19 07:19:57 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.c: Added underlines to all menus, now pressing [ALT]-f opens

	* gmenu.[ch], tree.c: Now items in the tree can be moved by dragging
	with the middle mouse button... WOOO HOOOOoooooo!

Tue Aug 11 07:43:52 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.c: Added gnome style toolbar in favor of the old row of
	buttons below the tree of menus. Main window is not displayed until
	after the menus are read, which was distracting attention from the
	standy dialog, resulting in a cleaner looking startup.

Mon Aug 10 08:41:14 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* tree.c: Quick hack to test a standby dialog while gmenu reads the
	menus. If interested in seeing 'walking gnome feet', please try this
	out and tell me if it's just code bloat. On really fast machines,
	this dialog may be too quick to really see anything.
	* wait-feet.h: The pixmaps for the walking feet. Was larger, but
	managed to use less colors to decrease size.

Sun Aug  9 14:12:18 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

Sun Aug  9 11:55:11 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.c (sort node), (sort_single_pressed), (sort_recurse_cb),

	* gmenu.[ch], dialogs.c, order.c, tree.c: Changed all casts of GList *
	to GtkCTreeNode *'s where applicable, and fixed all the other casts

	* tree.c (add_main_tree_node): instead of root, check for system menu

Tue Jul 21 00:39:15 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.h, edit.c, dialogs.c: fixed bug that caused a segfault or
	duplicate directory tree cration when an entry is saved multiple
	times successively. Desktop entry items that do not apply when editing
	a directory's properties are greyed out.

Mon Jul 20 22:50:21 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.[ch], edit.c, order.c, tree.c, dialogs.c: added ability to
