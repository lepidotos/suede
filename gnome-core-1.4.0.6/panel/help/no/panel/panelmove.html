	To add a new <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Panel</SPAN
> to your desktop,
	select the <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Create panel</B
> command
	from <B
CLASS="GUISUBMENU"
>Panel</B
> menu. You have a choice of
	five possible panel types:
      </P
><P

><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>	    
	    <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Edge Panel</B
></TT
> &#8212; An Edge Panel is
	    exactly like the main Panel that starts up with GNOME; it
	    stretches along the whole length of one of screen
	    edges. By selecting this type of panel you may add a new
	    Panel to another edge of your screen to give yourself more
	    functionality.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>	    <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Aligned Panel</B
></TT
> &#8212;  Aligned Panel
	     is also positioned along one of the screen edges. But
	     unlike the Edge Panel, the Aligned Panel will not stretch
	     across the entire edge of the screen it is on: it will
	     only stretch as much as necessary to  display the icons
	     and applets it contains. It can be positioned either at
	     one of the corners (in this case, it will stretch towards
	     the opposite corner) or at the center of the edge (in
	     this case, it will stretch in both directions,
	     automatically recentering when you add new objects).
            </P
><P
> If the Aligned panel is aligned with one of the
	    corners, the hide buttons will work slightly differently
	    than for the Edge Panel.  The hide button closest to the
	    edge of your screen will hide the Panel as usual but the
	    other hide button will send the whole panel to the
	    opposite edge. When the latter move is made it will not
	    hide the Panel since it is changing the side of the screen
	    it resides on.  If you want to hide it you will have to
	    press the hide button once again.
	      </P

CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Sliding Panel</B
></TT
> &#8212; This type
 	        of panel is very similar to the Aligned Panel, but can
 	        be placed anywhere along the screen edge, not
 	        necessarily in one of the corners or in the center. As
 	        you add objects, it will only grow in one directions
 	        &#8212; it won't automatically recenter.

>Menu Panel</B
></TT
> &#8212; The
		<SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Menu Panel</SPAN
> is a special panel
		which is always placed at the top of your screen and
		contains several pull-down menus.  These are
		<B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Programs</B
>,
		<B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Favorites</B
>,
		<B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Settings</B
>,
		<B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Desktop</B
>, a clock/calendar, and a
		special launcher which provides quick access to
		GNOME-related Internet resources (look for the bullet
		hole icon).  This panel can also hold the other
		objects which other panels can hold, but it does not
		have the configuration properties which other panels
		have. Note that the <SPAN
CLASS="INTERFACE"
>Menu Panel</SPAN
> is
		more restrictive than other panels, and some normal
		panel operations, such as moving the panel, cannot be
		performed on it.
