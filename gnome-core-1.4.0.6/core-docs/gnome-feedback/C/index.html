      <P
>     If you have found a bug in one of GNOME applications, please
   report it! Developers do read all the bug reports and try to fix
   these bugs. Please try to be as specific as possible when
   describing the circumstances under which the bug shows (what
   commands did you enter? which buttons did you click?). If there were any
   error messages, be sure to include them, too.  
      </P
> 
      <P
>	The easiest way to report bugs is by using <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Bug
	  Report Tool</TT
> (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>bug-buddy</B
>),
	  available in the <B
CLASS="GUISUBMENU"
>Utilities</B
> submenu
	  of <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Main Menu</B
>. This utility will guide you
	  through the bug reporting process; it will also
	  automatically collect some information necessary for
	  developers, such as versions of the operating system and
	  libraries you are using.
      </P
>
      <P
>	You can also submit bugs and browse the list of known bugs by
	connecting to the <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>GNOME bug tracking
	database</A
>.  You will need to register before you can
	submit any bugs this way  and do not forget to read
	<A
HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/bugwritinghelp.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Bug
	Writing Guidelines</A
>. 
      </P
>
      
      <P
>	Please note that some of GNOME applications are developed by
	commercial companies (these products are
	still free software). For example,
	<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Nautilus</TT
> file manager is developed
	by <A
HREF="http://www.eazel.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Eazel</A
>
	while <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</TT
> groupware suite is
	developed by <A
HREF="http://www.ximian.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Ximian</A
> (formerly Helix
	Code). Bugs reports and comments about these products should
	be directed to the respective companies. If you are using
	<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Bug Report Tool</TT
>, it will
	automatically send bug reports to the correct database.   
      </P

      <P

	If you have a suggestion or want to request a new feature for
      one of the applications, it can also be done using the bug
      tracking database. Submit your suggestion as a bug report as
      described in  and at the appropriate
      step select <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Severity: Enhancement</B
></TT

      <P
> If you found an inaccuracy or misprint in one of GNOME
	documents, or have any comments or suggestions about
	documentation, please let us know! The easiest way of doing so
	is by submitting a bug report as explained before and
	selecting <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Component: docs</B
></TT
> at appropriate
	steps (or <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>general</B
></TT
> if there is no
	<TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>docs</B
></TT
> component). If your comment is about
	general GNOME documentation (such as <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>GNOME Users
	Guide</I
>) rather than specific application manual,
	select <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Product: gnome-user-docs</B
></TT
>.
      </P
>
      <P
>	Alternatively, you can just send your comments by email to
	<A
HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/"

>GNOME
	Documentation Project</A
>; our address is
	<TT
CLASS="EMAIL"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:docs@gnome.org"
>docs@gnome.org</A

	a developer but want to help GNOME 
	<A

TARGET="_top"
>join
	the GDP</A
