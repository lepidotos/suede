>      A <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Secondary Section"</SPAN

      front-matter section of the <A
HREF="fdl-section1.html#FDL-DOCUMENT"
>Document</A
> that deals exclusively
      with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the
      Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
      matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within
      that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
      legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
      regarding them.

      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
      to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited
      directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
      images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
      drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
      suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
      translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
      whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy
      that is not <SPAN

      <SPAN

      plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
      format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
      standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
      modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
      proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
      and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
      machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for
      output purposes only.

      title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
      hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in
      the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title
      page as such, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Title Page"</SPAN

      most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.
