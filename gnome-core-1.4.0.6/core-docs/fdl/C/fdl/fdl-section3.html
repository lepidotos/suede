> numbering more than 100,
      and the Document's license notice requires <A
HREF="fdl-section1.html#FDL-COVER-TEXTS"
>Cover Texts</A
>, you must enclose
      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
      Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
      Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
      clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
      copies. The front cover must present the full title with all
      words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
      limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
      <A
HREF="fdl-section1.html#FDL-DOCUMENT"
>Document</A
> and satisfy these
      conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.

>      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
      adjacent pages.

>Document</A
> numbering more than 100,
      you must either include a machine-readable <A
HREF="fdl-section1.html#FDL-TRANSPARENT"
>Transparent</A
> copy along with
      each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
      material, which the general network-using public has access to
      download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
      protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take
      reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
      copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
      remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
      or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
      public.

      of the <A

      redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance
      to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
