>      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
      freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
      License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
      free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. 
      This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
      Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit 
      to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered 
      by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it 
      to your programs, too.
    </P
><P
>      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
      programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    </P
><P
>      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
      copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    </P
><P
>      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
      for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
      must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
      must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    </P
><P
>      We protect your rights with two steps:

	    distribute and/or modify the software.
	  </P
></LI
></OL

    </P
><P
>      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If 
      the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its 
      recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any 
      problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' 
      reputations.
    </P
><P
>      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
      individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
      licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

      follow.
