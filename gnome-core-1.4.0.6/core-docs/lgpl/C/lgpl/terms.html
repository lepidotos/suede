	      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility

><P
>	      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
	      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the

	      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
	      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square

	      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	      on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of

	      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	      collective works based on the Library.
	    </P
><P
>	      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
	      with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of

	      the scope of this License.
