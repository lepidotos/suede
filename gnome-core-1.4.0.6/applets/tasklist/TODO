DONE 1.  italic text for iconized (shaded?) windows 
DONE 2.  become flicker free for deskswitching when
	all windows are shown
3.  adjust to panel size hints  (should have an
	'override panel hints' options where user
	can specified desired rows/width)
4.  vertical tasklists should be sized by number
	of rows to be visible, not pixels
5.  vertical tasklists should be able to have a
	scrollbar, since they don't auto-shrink
DONE 6.  fix tasklist width being hardcoded to max
	of 1024; some people have higher res,
	and a short tasklist looks odd.
7.  add option to not show transient windows
8.  add option to make tasklist "greedy".  ie
	to have the tasklist fixed width, but
	to however much space is available.
