2002-01-21  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* deskguide-applet.c: Apply patch from Russel Steinthal to fix
	the limit on MAX_DESKTOPS and make it dynamically allocated.
	Fixes #3456.
	
2002-01-09  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* help/it/desk-guide.sgml: Fix typo. From Shingo Akagaki
	<dora@kondara.org>.
	
2001-10-17  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: Default to no thumbnails. If only to save some
	power for our poor laptop users :)
	
2001-06-20  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* gwmthumbnail.c: Fix code to be triggered by failure to
	allocate X shared memory. From Doug Larrick <doug@ties.org>.
	* deskguide_applet.c: Make all uses of the gettext macros
	look like _() and N_(), not _ () and N_ ().
	
2001-04-27  Leandro su Nerone  <leandro@firenze.linux.it>

	* help/it/desk-guide.sgml: Little adjustment

Thu Mar  1 05:21:04 2001  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (thumb_queue_step): don't do thumbnail shooting on
	iconified or shaded windows.

	* gwmh.h (struct _GwmhTask): made width/height/x/y 32bit ints,
	to avoid crashes with excessive window sizes.

	* gwmdesktop.c (task_remove_thumb): fixed thumb_queue cleanup
	code (a bug that could cause segfaults after thumbnailing was
	turned back on).

	* gwmthumbnail.c (gwm_thumb_nail_destroy): pass the thumbnail in the
	destroy function.

2001-01-31  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* deskguide_applet.c: Added a boolean config option for "Show
	tasklist arrow", default to true.  Also renamed the "Switch
	tasklist arrow" to a more descriptive "Switch horizontal/vertical
	position of tasklist arrow".

Tue Dec 05 20:08:49 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* deskguide_applet.c: bind signals on applet-widget BEFORE
	  we call applet_widget_add, as otherwise there is a race where
	  we may not get them.

Wed Nov 29 13:01:34 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): take deco window movement
	setting into account for double clicks.

	* deskguide_applet.c: sawfish doesn't move decoration window anymore.

2000-11-28 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* update help/C/desk-guide.sgml based on user feedback

Fri Nov 17 08:20:11 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.[hc]: update all relevant places where a VERSION
	number is required, introduced DESKGUIDE_VERSION define.

2000-11-15  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gwmthumbnail.c (gdk_image_get): gdk_window_get_visual() always
	returns NULL for pixmaps, so only require a visual when the window
	is not a pixmap

Tue Nov 14 21:01:39 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gwmthumbnail.c: #endif should have no arguments, fixes warning

Tue Nov 14 09:03:46 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_about): up version number to 0.4 to distinguish
	new bug reports.

	* gwmh.[hc]: added gwmh_task_steal_qdata().

	* gwmthumbnail.c:
	* gwmdesktop.c: fix thumbnail destruction.

Tue Nov 14 05:20:38 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmthumbnail.c (gwm_thumb_nail_update_drawable): assure that the
	window we're thumbnailing has reasonable width and height.

Tue Nov 14 04:23:58 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (get_task_root_and_frame): shut up for a creation/destruction
	race that we already handle gracefully.

	* gwmdesktop.c (thumb_queue_remove): put in a paranoia check.
	i want backtraces if this is triggered.

	* deskguide_applet.c: reenable thumbnail shooting.

	* gwmthumbnail.c (pixbuf_from_drawable): account for failing gc
	creation. gdk_window_get_visual() may return NULL, so get the
	depth from the colormap.

2000-11-02  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* deskguide_applet.c: disable thumbnails by default since this
	eats CPU on slow machines and seems to crash for quite a few
	people

2000-10-25  Karl Eichwalder  <ke@suse.de>

	* deskguide_applet.c: s/Sawmill/Sawfish/.

Sat Oct 14 15:27:47 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gstc.c (gstc_parent_add_watch)
	  gwmh.c (gwmh_init) (get_typed_property_data)
	  (get_task_root_and_frame) (gwmh_desk_update) (gwmh_task_update)
	  (gwmh_task_get_mini_icon):  Correct sigedness problems
	  (gint vs. guint) when passing pointers.

Mon Oct 9 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net> 

	* updating desk-guide.sgml desk-guide-applet.sgml for Nautilus 
	compatibility

Mon Aug 14 17:38:07 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmthumbnail.c (gdk_image_new_shared_with_pixmap): check whether we
	actually got the window's visual, we'd crash occasionally otherwise.

Wed Aug  9 02:25:08 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_widget_button_toggle_task_list): grab keyboard
	as well to cacth ESC for popdown.

Wed Aug  9 02:04:05 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_widget_button_toggle_task_list): popdown
	taskview automatically if this option is enabled at pointer clicks
	outside of the task view dialog.

Wed Aug  9 01:39:07 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (thumb_queue_step): disable incremental thumb updates
	during gtk grabs.

Sat Aug  5 22:55:49 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: scratched the double_buffering option.
	added options to enable/disable thumb nail shooting and to
	configure incremental update delays.
	the default setting doesn't even consume more CPU usage than
	the cpu load applet on my machine, let's see how that works
	out for other people.

Sat Aug  5 19:59:53 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.[hc]: always keep double buffering pixmap, support
	incremental updates (major speedup) and window thumbnail fillings
	from GwmThumbNail pixbufs.

	* gwmthumbnail.[hc]: thumb nail from live drawable implementation.
	contains lots of Gdk wrapper functions (fixups to avoid premature
	aborts) and GdkPixbuf extensions to create/update RGB buffer
	contents from screenshots.
	
	* applied patch for icon names from andersca:

2000-06-21  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

        * gwmh.c (gwmh_property_atom2info): Declare WM_ICON_NAME atom.
        (gwmh_task_update): Change the icon_name if the atom has changed.
        (task_new): Set icon_name to NULL on creation.
        (task_delete): Set icon_name to "DELETED" when deleted.

        * gwmh.h (struct _GwmhTask): Add icon_name field.

2000-05-21  Karl Eichwalder  <ke@suse.de>

	* help/de/desk-guide.sgml: SGML fixes.
	* help/de/desk-guide-applet.sgml: Ditto.
	
Fri May 19 02:08:22 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.desktop (Name[de]): changed german translation
	of deskguide from "Desktop-Überblick" to "Desktop-Übersicht".
	i'm not sure translating proram *names* is a good idea at all.

Fri May 19 01:48:47 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (get_task_root_and_frame): take into account that
	gdk_window_ref_from_xid() may return NULL if the XWindow id
	isn't valid anymore.
	TASK_XROOT(): same here.

Fri May 19 01:20:43 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.[hc]: cleanup of the prematurely committed
	GWMH_TASK_INFO_WM_HINTS path from andersca.
	this is the deal: most GWMH_TASK_INFO_* flags are used to
	1) flag internally that the task structure needs updating
	2) detailedly report to notifiers that something has changed
	with GWMH_TASK_INFO_WM_HINTS, 1) doesn't really apply, because
	we don't want to duplicate all WM_HINT info in the task structure.
	so there's a new flag group now: GWMH_TASK_INFO_UNOTIFY, which
	covers all notify flags purely needed for notification reports.
	(GWMH_TASK_INFO_UNOTIFY also needed to be incorporated into
	GWMH_TASK_INFO_ALL, so notifiers get initial reports).

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_property_atom2info): fix coding style.
	(task_event_monitor): remove atom special casing, we already
	have a generic mechanism to handle various atom changes and
	necessary notification.
	(gwmh_task_update): handle GWMH_TASK_INFO_UNOTIFY in the task
	info mask, i.e. leave the task structure alone here and simply
	pass the mask on for notification.

	* deskguide_applet.c (main): indentation fixes.

2000-05-13 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* fixed dtd <note> problem in desk-guide.sgml

2000-05-09  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gwmh.c (task_event_monitor): check for WM_HINT changing
	(gwmh_property_atom2info): add WM_HINT stuff

	* gwmh.h (GwmhTaskInfoMask): add the WM_HINTS flag

2000-05-04  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_draw): revert something I
	accidentally committed

	* deskguide_applet.c (main): set the default icon

2000-05-02 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* updated desk-guide.sgml, deskguide-properties.png and 
	deskguid-properties-advanced.png to update docs to reflect
	timj's changes

Mon May  1 03:42:04 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (task_event_monitor_frame_wrapper): provide a wrapper
	function for the event monitor used on the frame window, as
	Gdk's event filters are buggy for installing the same callback
	multiple times on a window. this fixes a nasty race, where
	events on newly mapped tasks were simply lost.

	* deskguide_applet.c: nuked the "?" show-properties button,
	and always show the pager. added a behaviour configuration
	option to automatically popdown the task view.
	minor cleanups.
	
	* gwmtaskview.[hc]: added ::popdown_request signal.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): bail out prematurely
	if the button press changed desktops. this way, tasks can only
	be activated on the current viewport.

	* gwmh.c (task_event_monitor): auto-unfocus unmapped and
	destroyed windows (spotted by andersca).
	(task_event_monitor): ignore NotifyPointer and
	NotifyInferior FocusOut events.
	(get_task_root_and_frame): always set the new xframe, even if
	==None.

2000-04-23 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* changed desk-guide.sgml in response to genuine reader
	feedback

2000-04-22 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* changed help/C/desk-guide.sgml to reflect sawmills impending name change


2000-04-14  Eric Baudais  <baudais@okstate.edu>

	* help/C/desk-guide-applet.sgml: Added a bit about trademarks.
2000-04-14  Eric Baudais  <baudais@okstate.edu>

	* help/C/*.sgml: Updated the docs to the 1.x template.

2000-03-30  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_phelp): sync with docs

2000-03-25  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_config_popup):
	(main): add help callbacks

Fri Mar  3 20:16:44 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_draw): minor appearance fix.

Wed Feb 23 08:10:52 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: show the task list upon arrow clicks.

	* gwmtaskview.c: the list doesn't do much yet, basically it
	only shows tasks that are clicked (upon button_releases
	<shudder>). discovered more clist problems and a bunch of
	sawmill bugs on the way, this is really getting frustrating.

Wed Feb 23 03:24:53 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.[hc]: added gwmh_window_send_client_message() to send
	arbitrary client messages for a GdkWindow to the root window.

	* gwmtaskview.[hc]: new widget displaying a task list, heck if
	clist wouldn't be so badly designed this list could actually
	make some sense.

Sat Feb 12 14:50:52 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_save_session): plugged a leak, based
	on a patch by Peter Hawkins <peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au>.

Wed Feb  9 03:27:40 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (get_typed_property_data): removed noisy warning
	("Property has wrong type, probably on crack") about
	mismatching property types, since for e.g. COMPOUND_STRING,
	we just try to get a STRING property first.

2000-02-06  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_get_mini_icon): Fix the XCopyArea so that
	it can handle icons that aren't 16x16 without displaying
	garbage on the edges.

Sun Feb  6 06:19:31 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c:
	applied changes to support COMPOUND_TEXT window names which is
	often used for internationalized window names, based on a patch
	by TANIGUCHI Toru <g97p0639@mn.waseda.ac.jp>.
	(get_typed_property_data): for COMPOUND_TEXT list returns, return
	the first text string.
	(gwmh_task_update): feature XA_COMPOUND_TEXT return types besides
	XA_STRING for XA_WM_NAME.
	(gwmh_task_get_mini_icon): cosmetic fixups.
	
	* deskguide_applet.c: adapt config options to newer sawmill
	versions.

2000-01-29  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_get_mini_icon): Added a check for NULL
	so that it wouldn't try to get pixmap when the KWM_WIN_ICON
	hint was set to 0x0, 0x0.

Tue Jan 04 00:19:21 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* deskguide_applet.desktop: use the PanelApplet dentry type

Fri Dec 24 12:27:06 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c: made desk-guide work on 64bit platforms (with lots of help
	from george lebl ;).
	scratched send_client_message_32(,...) in favour of the two new variants
	send_client_message_2L() and send_client_message_3L() to send client
	messages with 2 or 3 longs respectively.
	changed a couple of functions to use send_client_message_2L() or
	send_client_message_3L() instead of send_client_message_32().
	(client_list_sync): operate on guint32 ids.
	(hack_a_client_list): return a guint32* array.
	(get_typed_property_data): for format=32 returns from
	XGetWindowProperty(), assume the values are actually sizeof(long)
	(i.e. *64* bit on some platforms) and convert the data accordingly if
	sizeof (gulong) == 8, so we always return guint32* arrays for format=32.
	(wm_protocol_check_support): don't assume Atom and guint32 have the same
	size, i.e. walk the Atom* array independantly from the guint32* array.
	(gwmh_desk_update): interpret the values returned from
	get_typed_property_data() for the GWMH_DESK_INFO_CLIENT_LIST case as
	guint32* array, not as Window* array.

Thu Dec 16 09:13:53 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_create_desk_widgets): 
	(gp_config_find_value): 
	(gp_config_popup): bunch of bugs fixed (sanity check config values,
	offer saved config values in GUI).

Sat Nov  6 01:00:21 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): added new feature, top-left
	center window within area on button2-double-click.

Thu Nov  4 01:08:46 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_init_gui): check the retrived pixel_size value,
	the panel sometimes (initially) returns 0, and we don't accept values
	smaller than 12.

Thu Nov  4 00:45:40 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_create_desk_widgets): folded in patch from
	george so we use the new applet_widget_get_panel_pixel_size()
	function. fixed 4 pixel bloat offset when laying out desktops acording
	to panel size (subtracted 2 * x/y-thickness).
	removed orientation reentrancy workaround, as george claims it's no
	longer needed.

Wed Nov  3 13:33:10 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_init_gui): hide `?' properties button by default
	to improve appearance with tiny panels.

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_widget_ignore_button): button press/click
	cleanups.

Sat Oct 30 13:10:16 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c:
	guarded a bunch of API calls against invalid tasks.
	(task_new): delete task immediatedly if we couldn't fetch the task's
	root or frame, return NULL for that case.
	(client_list_sync): skip NULL tasks from client list.
	(gwmh_task_update): don't immediatedly delete tasks, but return FALSE
	to indicate that the task isn't especially valid anymore and queue
	a client list update so we get rid of this task as soon as possible.
	(task_delete): added two task list checks (expensive).
	(client_list_sync): added an expensive assertment on the rebuit
	client_list.
	the latter three paranoia checks, can be removed if desk-guide
	doesn't crash for 42 days ;)

Mon Oct 25 01:37:41 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: added gp_config_check() which can change config
	widget sensitivity due to specific config values. made Height and
	Width spinners insensitive when "override with panel size" is set.

Mon Oct 25 00:57:42 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_init_gui): translate the result from
	applet_widget_get_panel_size() into *hardcoded* pixel sizes:
	static guint panel_sizes[] = { 24, 48, 64, 80 };
	gp_panel_size = panel_sizes[applet_widget_get_panel_size (applet_widget)];
	i can smell this blowing up some day, definitely ;(

	* deskguide_applet.c: added configuration options to specify that
	the pixels sizes should actually be fetched from the panel.
	added divide-by-# of rows/columns feature for george and boc.

Sun Oct 24 21:55:06 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: exposed violate_client_msg in configuration
	options.

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_desk_set_hack_values): added violate_client_msg flag
	to identify window managers that expect us to modify current desktop
	and current task properties on the client windows directly, instead
	of sending a client message (this is in violation with the GNOME WM
	Spec).

	*gwmh.c (gwmh_task_set_desktop): 
	(gwmh_task_set_area): modify properties directly is
	gwmh_hack_violate_client_msg is set.

Sun Oct 24 10:32:28 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: prefixed all config sections with `sect_',
	so our settings don't get confused with those of other applets
	(why the heck isn't `privcfgpath' passed as application-*specific*
	prefix???). either the panel or the config system screw here majorly ;(

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_config_add_range): shrink spin buttons.

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_config_items): majorly reordered and reworded
	configuration settings according to the GNOME UI Hit Squad page, at
	least in the areas where the proposed changes actually made sense.

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_config_add_section): 
	(gp_config_create_page): changed spacings/borders to what is recommended
	by the GNOME UI Hit Squad:
	http://www.jcinteractive.com/gnome-ui/hitsquad/deskguide_applet.html

Wed Oct 13 02:02:26 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: fixed configuration options. updates to reflect
	last SawMill version (moves decoration window instead).

1999-10-08  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* gnome-deskguide.png: Slightly polished pixmap. Stefan's a
	perfectionist.

Fri Oct  8 00:56:10 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_desk_notifier): uh oh, fixed a bad bad bug that
	caused all desktop widgets to be destroyed and recreated upon area
	changes. caused bad bad flickering, in the end that's not what we wrote
	double buffering for.

Thu Oct  7 14:04:01 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: added bug-fixing option to configure unified_area
	support for different window managers (FVWM2 and SawMill need this).

	* gwmh.[hc]: added support for wms with unified areas, i.e. where
	the current area always changes on all desktops. we should evaluate
	a _WIN_UNIFIED_AREA property at some point to figure this, but
	until then i simply added gwmh_desk_set_hack_values() to hard configure
	certain bug workarounds.
	John Harper <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk> provided significant code
	portions for the unified_area support.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_desk_notifier): always update our idea
	of the current area if GWMH_DESK_INFO_CURRENT_AREA changed, no
	matter whether we are the current desktop.

	* gwmh.c (hack_a_client_list): grab the server while doing excessive
	tree queries.

Thu Oct  7 02:46:20 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_create_desk_widgets): feature stacking of
	desktops into a specified number of columns (rows) and wrap them
	around upon packing. this allowes for the much requested "grid"
	layout of desktops (as opposed to the normal grid layout of areas
	which works fine out of the box already).
	the number of rows/columns can be configured through the geometry
	page in the properties dialog.

	i'm wondering what else people will request from deskguide to fit
	their needs, someone's probably still hiding, wanting to request
	INBOX folder browsing support ;)

Thu Sep 23 22:27:34 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_set_area): 
	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_set_desktop): since most window managers didn't
	actually follow the spec to honour a client message for desktop and
	area changes, we have to violate the spec here as well, and modify the
	properties directly (besides sending the client message) ;(

Thu Sep 23 21:06:50 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.[hc]: 
	* gwmh.[hc]:
	* gstc.[hc]: foooof. after 14h of hacking and debuging,
	desk-guide is actually able to deal with non-gnome compliant
	window managers. it performs all neccessary tasks, such as fetching
	client list etc... itself. deep magic ;)
	as a neat side effect, desk-guide can actually manage the desk solely
	now, if no window manager is at all present.
	probably the first and only pager that capable ;)
	window manager switching works fine in general, i.e. between compliant
	window managers as well as non-compliant ones, back and forth. there
	are just a few very old twm-based cripples that cause gdk to crash by
	destroying windows immediatedly after a ConfigureEvent arrived (fixed
	in Gtk+-1.2.5).
	i changed the intial error dialog to an alert dialog that strongly
	recommends compliant wms, but we may actually remove this dialog now.

Thu Sep 23 20:24:42 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.[hc]: added detected_gnome_wm field to the desk structure,
	so users can figure if we have a compliant window manager. this
	value may now change during a programs lifetime, i added appropriate
	"reboot" hooks to the gwmh code to be triggered upon window manager
	changes. detected_gnome_wm should always be checked by interested
	applications if the notification mask contains GWMH_DESK_INFO_BOOTUP.

	* gwmh.c (task_delete):
	* gstc.c (gstc_parent_delete_watch): 
	carefully reset event masks on foreign windows.

Thu Sep 23 19:12:45 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* ok, got the last bits worked out for non gnome compliant window
	managers, basically, we have to do everything ourselves, i.e.
	guess what the actuall client list is. this would be easy if there
	were no window manager at all, but with all the decorations floating
	around, it's hard to tell what an actuall task is.
	hopefully the current heuristics proove to be usefull in the common
	case.

Thu Sep 23 17:25:39 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c: reset GWMHA atoms if no GNOME comlainant window manager
	is present, that way we don't get bogus proprtty values.

Thu Sep 23 14:06:17 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.[hc]: added GWMH_DESK_INFO_FORCE_EVERYTHING value, so the
	user can forcefully update everything (happens upon gwmh_init()
	as well).

	* deskguide_applet.c (main): queue a GWMH_DESK_INFO_FORCE_EVERYTHING
	update if we don't know the window manager, so the newly setup
	notifiers get called.

Thu Sep 23 13:46:28 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: added bug-fix configure option to workaround
	window managers that move their decoration windows instead of the
	application window upon XMoveWindow(), occurs with at least
	AfterStep, Enlightenment, FVWM and IceWM.

Thu Sep 23 10:43:43 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_update): translate frame and window coordinates to
	current desk when updating geometries.

Thu Sep 23 09:50:42 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwmh_desktop_motion): constrain movement area to our
	window plus a threshold border of 5 pixels.
	(gwm_desktop_button_release): abort task moves.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): only show tasks and change
	desktop+area on button1. tasks can be moved now with button2.
	(policy suggested by owen).
	
	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_draw): fixed a minor offset problem with
	setting x/y_origin.

Thu Sep 23 08:33:58 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_create_desk_widgets): don't poke around
	indelicately in foreign class structures, use gwm_desktop_class_config()
	now. set desired area size from newly added configuration options.

	* gwmdesktop.[hc] (gwm_desktop_class_config): new function to set global
	class configuration, will automatically update all existing widgets.

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_init_gui): changed packaging so we don't expand
	the desktop widgets by default and with that destroy the constrained
	aspect ratios.

Thu Sep 23 05:35:41 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: internationalized the configuration option
	array (Andreas Persenius <ndap@swipnet.se>).

1999-09-18  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* *.png: Transparency added to pixmaps.

1999-09-17  Richard Hult  <rhult@hem2.passagen.se>

	* deskguide_applet.desktop: Added Swedish desktop entry.

Fri Sep 17 13:55:27 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: show hidden tasks by default.

	* gwmh.[hc]: added GwmhHints, GwmhState and GwmhLayer enums, adapted
	code to not use the namespace polluting WIN_* cruft from gnome
	anymore.

Fri Sep 17 13:17:31 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: feature ->raised_grid in property dialog.

	* gwmdesktop.[hc]: added ->raised_grid class field so people that want
	it can have the grid drawn on top of the tasks.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_map): make sure we are queued for a redraw
	if we draw double buffered, since our expose handler relies on ::draw
	being already called.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_draw): always draw border on top of the
	tasks.

1999-09-15  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* deskguide_applet.c: Replaced TRANSL with _() to get the
	strings to show up in gnome-core.pot.
	* deskguide_applet.h: Commented out #define TRANSL......
		
1999-09-12  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* *.png: Pixmaps added; used in about dialog and desktop entry.

Sat Sep 11 17:59:16 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): supplement the x_comp and
	y_comp values by the (frame - win) position distance.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwmh_desktop_motion): don't recalculate (win.{x,y} -
	frame.{x,y}) upon every single move, simply rely on x_comp and y_comp.

Sat Sep 11 17:27:35 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_property_atom2info): translate property atoms to
	info flags, according to desk-relative or task-relative properties.

1999-08-21 Anders Carlsson  <anders.carlsson@tordata.se>

	* gwmh.c: Fixed error with the KWM_WIN_ICON hint.

Fri Aug 20 12:36:57 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* stripe.xbm: removed

	* gwmdesktop.c: use a checker board to indicate active area.

Fri Aug 20 11:09:48 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.[hc]: added a ::check-task signal to determine
	visibility of individual tasks.

	* deskguide_applet.c: connect to GmwDesktop's ::check-task signal
	for all desktops to hide tasks according to the new config flags
	show_hidden_tasks, show_shaded_tasks, show_skip_winlist and
	show_skip_taskbar.
	don't show iconified tasks at all.

Fri Aug 20 10:28:55 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.[hc]: split up gwmh_task_show() into gwmh_task_deiconify(),
	gwmh_task_focus(), gwmh_task_raise() since some code needs only
	part of the show() functionality.
	gwmh_task_show() still incorporates the functionality of the above
	fucntions and is more efficient since it coalescs the task updates
	and will only sync once. though, it will not try to assign focus to
	SKIP_FOCUS tasks anymore. it'll also unshade shaded tasks now.

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_get_mini_icon): fixed this function up a bit
	(codingstyle), added assertments, get_typed_property_data() returns
	memory allocated through glib, so use g_free not XFree.

1999-08-04 Anders Carlsson <anders.carlsson@tordata.se>

	* gwmh.[hc]: Added gwmh_task_get_mini_icon

Tue Jul  6 12:47:37 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): don't change desktops
	(pages) on button press if Control is being held, so windows can
	be dragged around in this case.

1999-07-05  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@comm2000.it>

	* deskguide_applet.c (main): Create applet "deskguide_applet", not
	"gnomepager_applet".

Sat Jun 26 01:57:11 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.h: 
	* gstc.h: provide workaround for G_GNUC_PRETTY_FUNCTION definition
	from old (pre 1.2.2) glib versions.

	* gwmdesktop.[hc]: widget derived from GtkDrawinArea to display
	a desktop and its pages.

	* gwmh.[hc]: GNOME window manager helper code to keep track of
