Gnome Help Browser & Sample Code
--------------------------------

This is a very basic help browser and a sample program (ripped from
gnome-hello) showing how to use it. The basic idea is there is a
topic.dat file which contains section names and the file which it
corresponds to. These cause the creation of menu entries under the 'Help'
menu of the main menubar of a GnomeApp. Look at the sample.c for more
details.

This requires you to check out a version of gnome-libs so that the 
gnome_app_create_menus() will work properly.

UPDATE (2/20/98)
----------------

Lots of new goodies!

 - history works now (back and forward buttons)
 - new internal structure for transport/mime conversion/etc
 - browse man pages!
 - simple http transport using 'lynx -source' - use as a WEB BROWSER
    (example:  gnome-help-browser http:/www.gimp.org/gtk/')

The program 'gnome-man2html' is installed in the standard bin location
for GNOME binaries, and is used by the help browser. Also, lynx is
expected to be on the standard PATH for http transfers.


UPDATE (1998-10-09)
--------------------
Now the gnome-help-browser is CORBA aware. Copy the browser.goad file
into the $(PREFIX)/etc/CORBA/servers directory. Now you can reset the
gnome-help-browser with the gnome-help-caller program to its startup
entry (toc:). Use the source of gnome-help-caller as an example how to 
control the help browser from other applications. The CORBA interface
is subject to change, this is a first implementation.
