 - TOC
   should set mime type
   toc:
   toc:{man,info,ghelp}
   toc:man(x)
   sort entries and then insert into g_list, g_list_insert_sorted() is
     inefficient

 - fix LANG handling
   needs to check C (or LINGUAS?) to find file

 - cache
   cache mime types
   cache over rides
   disk cache

 - names

 - add configuration stuff:
    toolbar preferences

 - session management

 - work on DocBook output to generate topic.dat automatically (need to use
   special tags in DocBook to denote links which should go into the 'Help' 
   menu).
 - Need to have help browser<->application communication for better
   integration into GNOME apps in the future

 - fix history
    geometry - figure out how to set column widths and let first one expand

 - can back/forward buttons have dropdown history?

 - make man2html & info (and other filters) loadable modules

 - image loading needs serious work when grabbing via transport other
   than local filesystem. Currently creates a temporary file in /tmp
   which is then passed on to the html widget for loading. These
   temporary files are never removed.
