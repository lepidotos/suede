	* configure.in: use the gnome 2 gettext macro, as the gnu one
	can't be made to be happy

2001-11-11  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: remove all the gnome stuff, since we don't need
	any gnome things

	* Makefile.am: use intltool

2001-11-09  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* Makefile.am:

	Remove @INTLTOOL_KEYS_RULE@ since we are using XML_I18N_TOOLS
	stuff instead for compatibility with GNOME1.
	Use XML_I18N_MERGE_KEYS_RULE instead.
	
	* configure.in:

	Finish making work on GNOME1. Should work on both GNOME1 and
	GNOME2 now.

2001-11-02  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	ignoring things that just aren't here.
	* gnome-vfs-mime-magic: Remove some spaces to make
	check-mime.pl happy.
	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Remove file type extensions from
	all icon filenames for clarity. Remove all icon filenames
	that exactly match the MIME type. We only need an explicit
	mention of the filename if it's not "gnome-<type>", where
	"<type>" is the MIME type with the "/" replaced by "-".

	end up working with GNOME1.

2001-11-01  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* autogen.sh:

	Give up and use GNOME2 macros...it works with GnomeVFS2
	now which is the most important part for now.

2001-11-01  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* .cvsignore:

	Add a cvs ignore file.

=Initial checkin to a seperate module.=

2001-10-24  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* gnome-vfs-mime-magic:

	Remove really questionable mime magic for detecting C/C++ files
	based on comment characters. This incorrectly detected Java files,
	and I don't know of an instance where a C/C++ file didn't
	have an extension, so mime magic really isn't useful here.
	
	* gnome-vfs.applications:
	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:

	Add x-dvi (already on the stable branch).

2001-08-22  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* gnome-vfs.mime: Map .ics to text/calendar

	* gnome-vfs-mime-magic: Add BEGIN:VCALENDAR so icalendar objects
	aren't identified as text/plain

2001-08-06  Darin Adler  <darin@bentspoon.com>

	* gnome-vfs.applications: Corrected name of AbiWord executable.
	According to Dom and ALex Larsson, it's AbiWord, not abiword.

	and still work for http URIs.

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Remove ntl_web_browser entries.

2001-06-14  Aaron Brick  <aaron@lithic.org>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:

	reverted application of the patch below, which was apparently
	ill-advised. more mysteries remain.

2001-06-13  Aaron Brick  <aaron@lithic.org>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	
	applied patch from Timothy Alan Chandler <fusion@heavywater.net>
	which corrects icon path and filenames. many were missing extension
	".png", and many needed to be preceded with the directory
	"nautilus/". NB: we suspect a kludge is in place which made this
	work before; it should be eliminated, afaict.

2001-06-13  Aaron Brick  <aaron@lithic.org>

	* changed my contact address for missing types.

2001-06-06  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

2001-05-24  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	don't get misidentified as text/plain

2001-05-14  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* gnome-vfs-mime-magic:

	Add more flexible checks for script files to handle things like
	'#! /bin/sh'.
	
	* gnome-vfs.applications:

	Change GIMP to not allow URIs. This seems to malfunction on
	many copies of the GIMP in the file:// case.

2001-05-01  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* data/mime/gnome-vfs-mime-magic:

	Add PHP support to the magic mime database.

2001-05-01  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.applications: Update entry for The Gimp so it
	knows that it can use http URLs.

2001-04-25  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.applications: Put in alphabetical order.

2001-04-23  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

2001-02-28  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	reviewed by: Pavel Cisler <pavel@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 7043, java files execute by default now.

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Removed the lines that make compiled java
	execute java by default. We can return to this issue later, along
	with the general issue of how to handle "execute-like" entries in
	this file. Most of the applications have "edit-like"
	behavior. Also removed the line that made the default for opening
	Java source code be the Java compiler. We don't invoke a C
	compiler when you open a C source file and we don't want to do it
	for Java either. Also removed an icon name that doesn't correspond
	to an actual icon.

	Fixed bug 5570, bmp file sometimes appears as an mp3 file
	
	* gnome-vfs-mime-magic:
	* gnome-vfs.mime:
	Add image/bmp rule. There was already information

	Fix bugzilla.eazel.com bug 7093

	* gnome-vfs.applications:
	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	Remove gnorpm from the list of applications,
	since it doesn't actually open rpm files when
	they are passed as arguments.

	Fixed bug 7095 (wrong icon used for HTML files in
	bookmarks & icon views)

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Removed icon for text/html. Nautilus has its
	own logic for dealing with html files that gets broken by a
	hard-wired icon here.  Maybe we should change the logic in
	Nautilus someday, but this is the safe right-before-release
	change.

	wherein DVI files are recognized as MP3 by adding magic-mime numbers
	for DVI.

	More fixes after adding more checks to check-mime.pl.

	* gnome-vfs.applications: Fixed a typo where it said
	"expect_uirs".
	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Fixed a couple of places that said
	"default_action" instead of "default_action_type". Got
	rid of some duplicate icon_filename entries. Fixed a few
	places that said "icon-filename".
	* gnome-vfs.mime: Fixed a place that said "regex.2"
	instead of "regex,2". Got rid of some stray "icon_filename".

	* gnome-vfs-mime-magic:

	* gnome-vfs.mime:
	Ran check-mime.pl and fixed some of the problems it reported,
	including a bad pattern for application/x-applix-spreadsheet,
	non-translated description for application/qif, and many
	entries that were not in sorted order. Wrote bug reports for

	* gnome-vfs-mime-magic:
	* gnome-vfs.applications:
	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	* gnome-vfs.mime:

	Added four bazillion applications and MIME types so we
	support all the GNOME 1.4 and extras applications and KOffice
	and lots of other random various applications and types.

2001-02-16  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* added pico (jpico)

2001-02-07  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* combed mc.keys for missed types, adding:

		application/x-slp
		application/x-tex (a duplicate)

		and dismissing the rest.

	* added a comment to the RPM-detecting magic.

2001-01-31  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	Fixed a typo in this file that was making 
	the vault unviewable by anything except mozilla.

2001-01-31  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.applications: Made check-mime happy by using a tab,
	not spaces, on the realplay line.

2001-01-30  Kenneth Christiansen  <kenneth@gnu.org>

	* gnome-vfs.mime: add abiword abw files.

2001-01-26  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* renamed realplayer executable "realplay"
	* added duplicate realplayer type application/vnd.rn-realmedia

2001-01-24  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* renamed "acrobat" "acroread" per the executable's name

2001-01-22  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Re-apply many changes that were lost
	when Kenneth created this file. Apparently he made it from
	and old version of gnome-vfs.keys.

2001-01-22  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 5845 (web bookmarks change to generic document
	icon after visiting)

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:

	Removed all the lines that specify "i-regular" for an
	icon filename. "i-regular" is the default anyway, so 
	specifying it will have no useful effect. In the case
	of bug 5845, it had a bad effect (prevented the special
	web icon from being used). Aaron had intended to make
	this change a while back.

	Note: this bug was marked PR3 so we might want to make this
	simple change on the branched gnome-vfs, if there is one.

2001-01-19  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Call it a StuffIt archive, not a
	StuffIt! archive. Also get rid of some strangely placed
	blank lines that might have caused some trouble.

2001-01-19  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	Marked text/x-sh as can_be_executable. This was
