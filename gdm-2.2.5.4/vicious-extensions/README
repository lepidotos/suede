This is a set of routines and other things I find useful in a bunch of
programs, it is NOT a library, it is to be included in your module through some
evil CVS magic.  It builds two .a libs which are NOT installed.  You just
add it to your toplevel SUBDIRS and then link your executable against it.
Nothing from this dir is installed.  Also add the following to your
configure.in:

AC_CHECK_FUNCS([setenv unsetenv clearenv])

The two libs and includes are:

	libvicious.a
	vicious.h

	libviciousui.a
	viciousui.h

Note that libviciousui depends on libvicious.

Feel free to hack on this and feel free to add and modify stuff.  If you do
modify stuff please fix all the modules that include this.

Note that by including this module you are allowing people to randomly fix your
use of these routines, so if you're an anal maintainer, this is not for you.
Though you could always just cut and paste.

Implementation notes:

  Namespace is "ve" except for "glade_helper" for glade helper and "hack_"
  for icon entry hack.  Those are different for historical reasons.
