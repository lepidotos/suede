Ahh news...

2.2.5.4 stuff:

- SECURITY FIX! Make sure the egid is reset to the user gid before
  starting a session.  This could present a security risk under a
  certain circumstances, that is if your /bin/sh does not drop privilages.
  It also fixes the failsafe gnome session

- PositionX and PositionY now take negative values that work
  like standard X geometries.  A negative value is an offset from
  the right/lower edge.

2.2.5.3 stuff:

- PAM support revamped.  Session open and credentials are done before
  we do anything else.  Also we work on one pam handle only, and
  yet again switch setcred/open_session order (Karsten Petersen, me)

- Autologin is now done with a separate pam configuration.  gdm-autologin
  service.  This just logs anyone in without asking for a password,
  but this makes autologin work on some all wankered pam setup.  Of course
  you must now modify gdm-autologin in addition to 'gdm' if you have
  some weird pam setup.

- Fix gdmconfig saving of server definitions

- Add possibility of multiline welcome message by use of '\n'

- Use the text dialog interface for more errors including the toplevel
  loop of death

- Fix a USR2 race in the slave if the main daemon is already dead
  (this makes 'killall gdm' work right)

- Translation updates (Kjartan Maraas, Gustavo Maciel Dias Vieira,
  Abel Cheung, Christian Rose, Duarte Loreto, Christian Meyer,
  Stanislav Visnovsky, Peteris Krisjanis, Artis Trops, Akira TAGOH, 
  Göran Uddeborg, Ole Laursen)

2.2.5.2 stuff:

- If multiple local servers are setup, then wait until one has started
  plus 3 more seconds before starting the next one, this prevents such
  not-good things such as full lockups happening

- Fix crash of greeter for timed login setups

- Keep 4 old copies of the X server logs to make debugging bad
  X setups easy

- The WM now supports NoInput windows, which improves gdm
  accessibility and makes it possible to run things like xscribble
  (Crossfire (from debian bug report) and moi)

- Minor leak fixes

- spec file updates (Gregory Leblanc)

- Translation updates (Roy-Magne Mo, Carlos Perelló Marín,
  Christophe Merlet, Khairulanuar Abd Majid)

2.2.5.1 stuff:

- IMPORTANT: XKeepsCrashing now has different semantics,
  all the logic of crash recovery is no in this script including
  gettext and finding the configurator and all that.  So
  the script no longer takes any arguments.  If you have custom
  versions of this script you will have to change them to reflect
  this.  As a result of this XKeepsCrashingConfigurators is gone

- Skipped a version number for greater stability

- By default also look for XFdrake as a configurator on X crashes
  to work on mandrake out of the box

- pam setup is now the same as in the redhat and mandrake
  packages

- If the X server crashes within 5 seconds of telling us it's
  ready, still treat it as a crash, since things like inability
  to open mouse makes it die after it tells us it's OK

- XKeepsCrashing now handles inability to open mouse and
  offers to run mouseconfig (or if that's not available
  just the x configurator it finds)

- Fix crash on FreeBSD with setenv with NULL (just treat NULL
  as empty string) (Heath Nielson)

- DESTDIR fixes (Frodo Looijaard)

- gdmopen now sets VT_NUMBER env var for it's child

- Focus issues fixed in gdmwm (the windowmanager of the greeter)

- Check for existance of a home directory.  If it doesn't exist,
  the user has the option of canceling the login or logging in with
  the home dir set to root.

- Many MANY races fixed in handeling of extra processes.  Gdm should
  now always clean up after itself well if killed.  And it will
  now not screw up if the child processes die too quickly.

- Some configure.in and build fixes, require libglade explicitly in
  the configure script and also make console helper enabled by default
  if it's possible to use it

- gdmXnestchooser now has quite a few more modes of operation, in effect
  it can now be used as a generic Xnext launching program.  It also
  by default reads the Xnest command from gdm.conf
  
- Remove VerboseAuth configuration variable as it was utterly useless,
  and actually resulted in usability degradation when on.

- Include our own gdmmktemp like the mktemp program for shell scripts

- Fix stuff on console with gdmopen by printing \033(K onto the console
  before it does anything else

- Work with KDE face directories (username.png rather then username) as
  well (Mandrake)

- Accept keypad enter in the greeter (Mandrake)

- Run ssh-agent if it is found available and not yet running in the Gnome
  session file (Ximian)

- Errors from pam go into a separate dialog and information messages that
  come just before login are also in a dialog so that the user gets
  a chance to see them

- Use the pam wait time on errors, if available, this fixes a bug where
  the wait time was doubled because it was both the pam one and the
  gdm one.

- Make sure the cookie file is full of all different local addresses
  and don't whack out if the local hostname is not resolvable.  Also
  if we still can't start the server, tell the user rather then giving
  up quietly.

- Always print the "Please enter your username" message

- Translation updates (Ole Laursen, Stanislav Visnovsky, Christophe Merlet,
  Peteris Krisjanis, Artis Trops, Marius Andreiana, Christian Rose, 
  Zbigniew Chyla)

2.2.4.3 stuff:

- Use PAM_ESTABILISH_CRED for pam_setcred

- Parsed login names are now reparsed every time

- Minor fixes and greater paranoia all over the place

- XDMCP timeouts default to 15 instead of 30 seconds

- Autoconf 2.50 / Automake 1.5 compatibility (Ali Akcaagac)

- Translations updated (Zbigniew Chyla, Kjartan Maraas, Ole Laursen,
  Fatih Demir, me, Stanislav Visnovsky, Gustavo Maciel Dias Vieira)

2.2.4.2 stuff:

- Keep a global pam handle around again, and add a pam conversation
  dialog when no greeter is up.  Set RHOST and RUSER and fix some
  other pam related things.  Hopefully we're more pam correct now.

- Have an option that forces 24hour clock even in locales which
  like 12hour clock (Terje Rosten, Ali Akcaagac, me)

- Change how FLEXI_XNEST works, be more paranoid in who we allow to
  run an an xnest, and we always run as the user who requested it.
  It requires that the user has a .Xauthority file with an
  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 for the current display.

- Fix many obscure fork races

- Now exports a procol version environmental variable to the greeter
  so that it's easier to use external greeters.

- Ensure that /tmp/.ICE-unix exists

- X servers now run with root gid and not gdm gid

- Ugly fix to the toolbar deadlock problem, very VERY evil, but
  it's really a bug in gnome-dock

- When we run a flexi console server, lock the screen with xscreensaver.
  Also throttle xscreensaver so that it doesn't take extra CPU power.

- Yet another extension to XDMCP, which makes the MANAGED_FORWARD
  stuff more reliable on bad networks.  It is however 100% compatible
  with 2.2.4.1 in operation.

- Minor fixes all over the place

- Documentation updates (Trevor Curtis)

- Translations updated (Zbigniew Chyla, Kjartan Maraas, Ole Laursen,
  Stanislav Visnovsky, Yukihiro Nakai, Roy-Magne Mo, Carlos Perelló Marín,
  Pablo Saratxaga, Christian Rose, Christophe Merlet, Christopher R. Gabriel)

2.2.4.1 stuff:

- X server editting now actually works, and gdmconfig produces
  correct config files.  DOH!

- X server editting now enforces strict order of servers (it only sort
  of did before)

- XDMCP can now run a script to get a custom WILLING status script
  (Matt Forrest, me)

- Change the gdm extension protocol to XDMCP.  The MANAGED_FORWARD
  was being used in a wrong way and required a slight protocol change,
  as this is a non-required part of the protocol nothing will break.

- When declining a connection, give statement why it is, to aid in
  debugging your XDMCP setup.

- Implement the (previously documented) xdmcp/DisplaysPerHost
  configuration option.  So now the default is one connection per
  host, so you may need to change this in your setup if you need
  more.

- Fix one case of s/login/username/ in the greeter and in XDMCP mode,
  the button to kill the login is "Disconnect" and not "Quit"

- The reference doc updated a tad, still somewhat out of date,
  the configurator documentation has not been updated however.

- Many, many fixes mostly leaks, some minor some bigger

- Updated translations (Christian Rose, Abel Cheung, Kjartan Maraas,
  Zbigniew Chyla)

2.2.4.0 stuff:

- New unix socket protocol for controlling the daemon from outside.

- A way to add servers at runtime by any local user.  So called flexible
  servers.  That is implementing a "New login" kind of thing.  This new
  server can also be a nested login with Xnest.  In which case anyone on
  an X connection can run this.  All without the use of XDMCP and openning
  up an extra TCP port.  This is more user friendly and also this way the
  daemon can manage the servers better.

- PAM usage more correct with respect to setting credentials.  This makes
  pam_group actually work, and probably some other things

- Implement a vt open (gdmopen) alternative inside gdm itself.  This
  version is stripped down version of open and it works much better for
  gdm's purposes of it.

- Implement a local helper (if pam is used) for the password asking
  when attempting to run X configuration.  This is more friendly
  and more correct.

- Keep track of all new helper processes and kill them off on exit.
  Previously some of these could be left hanging.

- When a display number is busy, ask the user about starting the
  server on an empty display number (if no gdmopen or dialog, just
  do it)

- Keep track of the VT (on linux) of local servers and allow programs to
  query this list through the socket protocol.  Perhaps to offer the
  user a menu and a gui way to switch between logins.

- More thorough closing of file descriptors.

- Also look for 'whiptail' when looking for a 'dialog' implementation

- In the photo setup, don't require a browser to be on.  In that case,
  just warn the user.

- Some doc fixes (Kjartan Maraas)

- Added Galician (gl_ES) and Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR) to the menu
  (Jesus Bravo Alvarez)

- Various minor fixes.

- RPM Epoch raised to 1 since it seems others have been in an Epoch arms
  race.

- Translation updates (Ole Laursen, Christophe Merlet, Abel Cheung,
  Jesus Bravo Alvarez, Pablo Saratxaga, Andras Timar, Zbigniew Chyla,
  Kjartan Maraas, Marius Andreiana, me)

2.2.3.2 stuff:

- printf/syslog format bugs fixed which fixes possible security
  problems (Cyril Diakhate, Abel Cheung, Havoc, me)

- Some fixes coming from the Gnome usability report (Heeten Choxi, me)

- Nicer titlebar

- Run /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d from the Gnome session

- RUNNING_UNDER_GDM defined for init scripts (Owen)

- Embrace and extend XDMCP so that choosing works nicer.  No worries, still
  100% compatible with XDMCP 1.0

- In the redhat package don't use the GiveConsole/TakeConsole since they're
  not kosher, pam does this for us, for standard, non rpm build this was never
  done

- s/Halt/Shut down/

- Don't ask to save Failsafe sessions

- When user doesn't exist, ask for a password anyway

- Various minor fixes (Owen, me)

- Translation updates (Stanislav Visnovsky, Zbigniew Chyla, Christian Rose,
  Faith Demir, Abel Cheung, Christian Meyer, Kjartan Maraas,
  Christopher R. Gabriel, Yukihiro Nakai, me)

2.2.3.1 stuff:

- file descriptor leaks and messups dealt with, making gdm2 work again
  on debian and probably others (Ryan Murray, me)

- Posibility of a "soft" restart, that is scheduling a restart when all logins
  end.  This is now possible from gdmconfig.

- A new "protocol" for the slave to talk to the daemon by way of a fifo.

- The spec file now schedules a soft restart on install (this will work only
  for upgrades from 2.2.3.1 to higher versions obviously)

- Handle the slave process crashing much more gracefully.  And be generally
  more thorough in killing our children.

- Killing an X server while running is no longer treated as an X crash by gdm

- Other cleanups and minor fixes

- Translation updates (Christian Rose, Ole Laursen, Zbigniew Chyla)

2.2.3 stuff:

- Various XDMCP fixes, including a working indirect queries (the host chooser).
  Plus various chooser enhancements and fixes

- The "window manager" better handles window positioning, to make programs
  like gkrellm behave more sanely.  Also follow the motif decoration hint.

- The internal error/info dialog uses GNOME to look prettier and is centered

- Build xdmcp only if the libs exist

- Handle upgrades more sanely.

- Scripts get correct environment

- On failsafe xterm session just warp the pointer to transfer focus,
  this makes pointer focus still work

- An option to always restart server rather then just reinitializing it
  when a user logs out

- XDMCP login box has a "Quit" menu item which kills the connection,
  useful if you chose a box you don't know the login to.

- Now handles busy server by notifying the user instead of treating it
  as a server crash

- Docs and configurator up to date to all new configuration keys
  (Trevor Curtis, me)

- Better pam and console helper configure setup and other configure fixes

- Add ja and zh_TW.Big5 translations again (Karl Eichwalder, me)

- Assorted fixes, cleanups (Kjartan, Nalin Dahyabhai, me)

- spec file cleanup (Dean Scott)

- Translations (Marius Andreiana, Christian Rose, Ole Laursen,
	        Karl Eichwalder, "R.I.P. Deaddog", Christian Meyer,
		Pablo Saratxaga, Kjartan Maraas, Christophe Merlet, 
		Khairulanuar Abd Majid, me)

2.2.2.1 stuff:

- SECURITY FIX!  Rebake cookies before reinitializing the local X server.
  Only local X servers are affected, this bug allowed an attacker to log in,
  save his cookie, which would then be used for the user who logs in next.

- Fix a race preventing users to log in sometimes

- Ability to turn of failsafe and chooser sessions (Havoc)

- Fix mit cookie usage to not clobber cookies containing zeros

- Fix remote XDMCP authentication

- Pinging for XDMCP sessions to detect if they're dead

- Saving current gnome session is done from gdm (gnome-core HEAD no longer
  saves it)

- Don't change utmp from Pre/Post session scripts

- PAM related fixes

- Better handeling of X failiures

- Nicer iconify button

- gdmphotosetup permissions fixes

- Always add POSIX/C locale setting to language menu

- Nicer minimize button

- Ignore .rpmorig files

- Other fixes

- Translations (Stanislav Visnovsky, Kjartan Maraas, me)

2.2.2 stuff:

- When X keeps crashing ask if we should run the X configuration
  (after asking for the root password of course:)

- Fixup shadow and crypt authentication methods

- Fix session directory reading in greeter (Rémi Cohen-Scali)

- Fix the -lwrap and other configure issues

- Better "management" of login screen windows

- The face browser actually works now (Rémi Cohen-Scali, me)

- A clock on the login window (Jonathan, me)

- The language list is now translated

- A small proggie to set your gdm browser face

- Accept clicks by the right button as if they are the first button,
  we don't know if the user is left or right handed yet

- Background color seeps through transparent images and allow limitting
  remote logins to only a color backgrounds

- Tooltips on things to make the greeter easier to understand

- AllowConfig now on by default

- Properly runs with a missing gdm.conf

- Remove old failsafe stuff and use the new builtin falisafes, which
  are much nicer

- Saner focus on all gdm windows, and give the failsafe xterm focus

- Gnome and Xsession default sessions now setup xresources and read in
  keymaps

- Default is default if no default was set and it exists (confusing huh? :)

- More Xinerama support (backgrounds, error dialogs, xterm failsafe session)

- Greeter segfault fixed when no lanugage file present

- Anti-hosification meassures.  GDM will now try to do something to allow
  itself to be fixed on some mistakes.  Rather then just aborting and leaving
  crap in the syslog.  And gdmconfig let's you see hosification as it hapens

- Updated fixed icon entry

- gdm-restart script to automate restarting of gdm by HUPing the main daemon

- Mucho fixes

- Bunch more tooltips on things

- Documentation is here! (Trevor Curtis, me)

- Updated translations (Khairulanuar Abd Majid, Christian Meyer, Ole Laursen,
  Kjartan Maraas, Christian Rose, Fatih Demir, Stanislav Visnovsky,
  Emese Kovacs, Matthias Warkus, Kjartan Maraas, Jarkko Ranta, me)

2.2.1 stuff:

- Keyboard navigation in the greeter (Ryan Murray)

- debian build stuff (Ian McKellar)

- Ability to set the background color/pixmap,
  now requires GdkPixbuf because of this.

- The root overlay window is gone now and we have real focus
  management.  In effect gdmlogin is a VERY simple windowmanager.

- Ability to choose a specific GNOME session

- Ability to run the configurator directly on the login screen,
  which requires a root password of course (Disabled by default)

- An editor for the Sessions directory in gdmconfig (Lee)

- Title bar can be hidden by configuration

- The icon entry is now sane with the panel icon entry hack

- If no LANG variable set gdm starts out in the DefaultLocale
  from the config file

- Now non-verbose mode is actually useful and verbose mode
  is still security safe.

- For consistency AllowRoot now works on pam setups as well,
  also a setting just for remote root logins.

- Timed login, you can set up gdm to log in a certain user on the
  first local display after a specified timeout if no one logs in
  (me, Jim Bray)

- Bunch of other fixes (me, Ryan Murray)

- Security fixes, crash fixes and an increase in general paranoia
  (me, Ryan Murray)

- More fault/bad setting tolerant all around

- Translation updates (Christian Meyer, Valek Filippov, Kjartan Maraas,
  Ole Laursen, Jarkko Ranta, Fatih Demir, Stanislav Visnovsky, Martin Norbäck,
  Christian Rose, Yuri Syrota, Christophe Merlet, Pablo Saratxaga, me,
  Ian McKellar)

2.2.0 stuff:

- gdmconfig now works with more fontsizes (me, Lee)

- Another minor xinerama fix

- Fixup the pam message voodoo, so that it now is at least functional even
  though it may not be pretty nor 100% correct.

- Initial gdmconfig documentation (Trevor Curtis, Lee)

- gdmconfig now correctly handles RelaxPerms (Lee)

- gdmconfig has now nice pam console helper setup (Lee)

- gladify/beautify gdmchooser (Lee)

- gdmchooser now apparently works with xdm (Matthias Clasen)

- Better specfile (Gregory Leblanc)

- Packagers should read the comment on end of config/gdm.conf.in (especially
  debian people)

- Configuration file now does not force the adobe version of helvetica, and
  postgres and pvm users are excluded by default (Vlad Hrachev)

- i18n fixes (Gediminas Paulauskas)

- New easter egg

- Bunch of minor fixes

- Translation updates (Yukihiro Nakai, Carlos Perelló Marín, Martin Norbäck,
  Fatih Demir, Simos Xenitellis, Kjartan Maraas, Christian Meyer,
  Christophe Merlet, Stanislav Visnovsky, me)

2.0.99 stuff:

- Cursor set to pointer rather then left as "X"

- Minor login minimize button cleanup (Jonathan Blandford)

- gdmconfig UI update and fixes (Lee Mallabone)

- Easter egg update

- Fixed restarting with HUP when xdmcp is on

- Login and Chooser fixed up for the true/false vs. 1/0 change (Tim Jansen)

- doc updates for true/false vs 1/0 fixups (Tim Jansen)

- Translation updates (Yukihiro Nakai, Christophe Merlet, Gustavo Maciel Dias
  Vieira, Fatih Demir, Simos Xenitellis, Kjartan Maraas, Stanislav Visnovsky,
  Pablo Saratxaga, Jarkko Ranta)

2.0.98.1 stuff:

- a minor Xinerama fix for dialogs

- small XDMCP fix, it apparently works for some people (Matthias Clasen)

- create config files during configure time (Peter Teichman, me)

- Mucho translation updates (Christian Rose, Dan Damian, Simos Xenitellis,
  Szabolcs Ban, Kjartan Maraas, Christophe Merlet, Christian Meyer)

2.0.98 stuff:

- spec file actually works (Lee Mellabone)

- Bigger! Better! Faster!  gdmconfig.  Much cooler and easier to use
  (Lee Mellabone)

- More xinerama fixes (Tim Jansen)

- A bit more xdmcp fixes which still don't make it run

- Bunch of other fixes and cleanups

- New translations (Stanislav Visnovsky, Jarkko Ranta, Valek Filippov,
  Simos Xenitellis)

2.0.97.1 stuff:

- Don't die on non-xinerama supporting display if compiled with xinerama lib

- First cut at a spec file for RedHat 6.x (may work on 7.0 as well maybe)

2.0.97 stuff:

- Graphical configurator in Foot/System/Gdm Confgiurator,
  or run "gdmconfig" (Lee Mellabone)

- i18n and greeter/slave communication fixes (ChiDeok Hwang)

- int vs. bool mess fixed up in the configuration files

- Use the language from the LANG variable as the default and use
  the one from gdm.conf as backup only

- Verbose authentication on by default and don't reveal information
  on verbose authentication.  I may remove this option altogether

- Slower quiver (looks cooler:)

- Reset on main process HUP signal by reexecing self

- Xinerama support for centering the login dialogs (Tim Jansen)

- Mucho fixes to loop of death stuff, race conditions and other such
  fun things

- Translations, fixes etc...
  (Kjartan Maraas, Gediminas Paulasukas, ChiDeok Hwang, Stanislav Visnovsky,
   Valek Filippov, and maybe others)

2.0.96 stuff:

- Multiple local display stuff should now work

- Now autologs in only on the first display

- Bunch of fixes for XDMCP but that still doesn't work, I need
  help here I think

- Local displays are now reset with SIGHUP rather then killed and
  signals are set properly to begin with, this should actually help
  with some buggy X servers I think.

- Login window can be moved (has a titlebar), and this position can be
  set from the config file (not saved however)

- Bunch of cleanup and bugfixes

Open issues:

- XDMCP doesn't work

- Autologin and i18n is not working well (always in english apparently)

2.0.95 stuff:

- Autologin (AutomaticLogin key in [daemon] section of gdm.conf)
  This is a string key that if it's set then gdm will log in that
  user without prompting on the first time it runs a local server.
  Will not autologin "root" though as that would be dumb.

- You can have your cursor anywhere while you log in, yay!

- [greeter]/BackgroundProgram thingie.  A program that is run from
  the greeter and killed when the greeter exists.  useful for things
  that do some cool graphics on the root window.

- If greeter keeps segfaulting, it will "unmanage" that display so that you
  can actually log in on a console

- Slave process is actually forked

- Bugfixes galore

-George
