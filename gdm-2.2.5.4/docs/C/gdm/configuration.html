      This chapter will cover the structure of the configuration
      directory and the format of the configuration file.  However you 
      can use the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdmconfig</TT
> binary to configure
      GDM from a graphical environment.  The terms from this chapter
      could however still come in handy.  If you want to run the
      configurator from the GNOME menu, it should be installed under
      the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>System</TT
> submenu.
    </P
><P
> 
      The configuration files for GDM are located in the
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>etc/gdm/</TT
> directory.
    </P
><P
>      This is a listing of the config directory contents:

><P
> 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdm.conf</TT
> is the main GDM configuration file. The
      options will be described later in this chapter.
    </P
><P
>      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdm.conf</TT
> is configuration file for both <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>      gdm</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdmlogin</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdmchooser</TT
> since a
      lot of parameters overlap.
    </P
><P
> 
      The remaining configuration is done by dropping scripts in the
      subdirectories of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>etc/gdm</TT
> folder. This
      approach makes it easy for package management systems to install
      window managers and different session types without requiring
      the sysadmin to edit files.

><P
>	In this section we will explain the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Init</TT
>,
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>PreRoot</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>PostRoot</TT
> directories as
	they are very similar.
      </P
><P
>	When the X server has been successfully started, GDM will try
	to run the script called
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Init/&#60;displayname&#62;</TT
>. I.e. <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Init/:0</TT
>
	for the first local display.  If this file is not found, GDM
	will attempt to to run <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Init/Default</TT
>. The
	script will be run as root and GDM blocks until it
	terminates. Use the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Init/*</TT
> script for
	programs that are supposed to run alongside with the GDM login
	window. xconsole for instance.  Commands to set the background
	etc. goes in this file too.
      </P
><P
> 
	It is up to the sysadmin to decide whether clients started by
	the Init script should be killed before starting the user
	session. This is controlled with the KillInitClients option in
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdm.conf</TT
>.
      </P
><P
>	When the user has been successfully authenticated, GDM tries
	to run the PreSession script. Similar to the Init-scripts,
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>PreSession/&#60;displayname&#62;</TT
> will be
	executed, if this file doesn't exist, GDM will attempt to run
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>PreSession/Default</TT
>. The script will be
	run as root and GDM blocks until it terminates. Use this
	script for local session management or accounting stuff. The
	$USER environment variable contains the login of the
	authenticated user. The script should return 0 on success. Any
	other value will cause GDM to terminate the current login
	process.
      </P
><P
>	Then the session script is run. Session scripts are located in
	the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>etc/gdm/Session</TT
> directory. Which one
	GDM runs, depends on the session the user chose in the
	Sessions-menu in the greeter. If no session is selected and
	the user has no last session stored in his
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.gnome/gdm</TT
> file, the system will choose
	or first script found or -- if
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Sessions/Default</TT
> exists -- this will be
	run. For instance you can create a symlink from
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Gnome</TT
> to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Default</TT
> to
	make Gnome the default desktop environment.
      </P
><P
> 
	When the user terminates his session, the PostSession script
	will be run. Operation is similar to Init and PreSession. That
	is, GDM will attempt to execute the script
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>PostSession/&#60;displayname&#62;</TT
> and if
	that doesn't exist <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>PostSession/Default</TT
>
	will be run. Again the script will be run with root
	priviledges, the slave daemon will block and the $USER
	environment variable will contain the name of the user who
	just logged out.
      </P
><P
>	Note that the PostSession script will be run even when the
	display fails to respond due to an I/O error or similar. Thus,
	there is no guarantee that X applications will work during
	script execution.
      </P
><P
> 
	Neither of the Init, PreSession or PostSession scripts are
	necessary and can be left out. At least one session script is
	required for proper operation.
