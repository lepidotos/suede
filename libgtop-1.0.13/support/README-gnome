Some files in this directory are taken verbatim from glibc.
Do not modify them.  If you find a bug, report it as you would any
glibc bug.

When updating the glibc files in the master Gnome repository, be sure
to use "cvs import".  That will ensure that any local changes are
merged in.

Yes, there are some minor local changes.  Hopefully these will be
sorted out with the glibc maintainer before long.

Notes on CVS import:

This directory has files from two "vendors".  There are, thus, two
vendor branches

	1.1.1	GNU
	1.1.2	SNPRINTF_de_Raadt

The files that have "vendor" versions are:

	argp-ba.c		GNU
	argp-eexst.c		GNU
	argp-fmtstream.c	GNU
	argp-fmtstream.h	GNU
	argp-fs-xinl.c		GNU
	argp-help.c		GNU
	argp-namefrob.h		GNU
	argp-parse.c		GNU
	argp-pv.c		GNU
	argp-pvh.c		GNU
	argp-test.c		GNU
	argp-xinl.c		GNU
	argp.h			GNU
	getopt.c		GNU
	getopt.h		GNU
	getopt1.c		GNU
	strcasecmp.c		GNU
	strndup.c		GNU
	strnlen.c		GNU
	strtok_r.c		GNU
	vasprintf.c		GNU
	vsnprintf.c		SNPRINTF_de_Raadt

To find out the list of changes made against a "vendor" revision, you
can say

	cvs diff -r <vendor-branch-tag> 

When any of these files are changed by the vendor, they can be
reimported.  At the time of importing, please make sure you use the
correct branch revision and vendor tag.

So, if you are importing changes to any of the `GNU' files, please use

    cvs import -b 1.1.1 gnome-common/support GNU <new-release-tag>

If you are importing changes to "SNPRINTF_de_Raadt" files, please use

    cvs import -b 1.1.2 gnome-common/support SNPRINTF_de_Raadt <new-rel-tag>
	         ^^^^^^^                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		 |			    |
		 Branch revision	    Vendor Tag

In other words the "Branch revision" and "Vendor Tag" must agree.

Good places to get "support" functions:

`libgnomesupport' is essentially a `glibc' emulation library, and hence
`glibc' itself is a good source.  However, some of the functions cannot
be easily ripped out and put here (esp. any of the stdio-derived
functions).  Other places are:

* libiberty from your friendly Cygnus source distribution, e.g.,
  binutils, gdb.  The only caveat is that these cannot be used drop-in:
  you have to remove references to other files in the Cygnus tree &c.

* libit, which appeared briefly on ftp://alpha.gnu.org

* Jim Meyering's collection from his `fileutils'/`sh-utils'/`textutils'
  packages
