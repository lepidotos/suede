    <para>
      <application>GNOME Mines</application> is included in the

    <title>Objective</title>

    <para>
      The object of <application>GNOME Mines</application> is for the
      player to flag all mines hidden on the playing grid and to uncover
      all the remaining squares.  If the player mistakenly uncovers
      a square containing a mine the game is lost.  Winning games are
      ranked by how quickly the play was completed.

        Play proceeds by uncovering squares with the left mouse button and
        placing flags with the right mouse button. Successfully uncovered
        squares yield information: the number of mines in the adjacent
        squares. Figure <xref linkend="begin-play-fig"> shows a game
        in play. Note the numbers in the cleared squares and their relation
        to flags.

        Using the information gathered from the uncovered squares the
        player forms hypotheses about the location of undiscovered mines.

      <para>
        As flags are added the middle mouse button may be used on the
        previously uncovered squares. If the number of flags adjacent
        to that square satisfies the number expected 
        the middle mouse button will automatically uncover all remaining
        adjacent squares. If a flag has been placed by mistake this action
        will uncover a mine and end play. Figure <xref linkend="fail-fig">
        shows the result of just such a mistake, note the flag in the
        top row.

      <title>Basic Strategy</title>

      <para>
        The geometrical arrangement of uncovered and flagged squares
        often limits the possible locations that can contain hidden
        mines. Figure <xref linkend="basic-corner"> shows how the location
        of a mine, pointed to by the arrow, has been inferred using the
        square on the outside corner showing the numeral one. The geometry
        of the corner has left only one uncovered square next to the one.

        The same strategy has been used in figure <xref
        linkend="basic-wall"> where the square showing the number three
        has only three remaining uncovered squares that can hold mines.

      <para>
         In the previous cases we found the location of mines using the
         information from a single uncovered square. More advanced play
         comes from combining information from two or more uncovered
         squares. Consider the arrangement of squares in figure <xref
         linkend="advanced-1">.

      <para>
         If we focus on the leftmost square showing "1" we know that only
         a single flag can be contained in the three uncovered squares
         highlighted in green in figure <xref linkend="advanced-2">,
         thus we can infer where the second flag for the square showing
         "2" must be placed.
