  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
   <application>Gataxx</application>, part of the GNOME-games suite of
   games, is a relative of other disc-flipping games such as
   <application>Iagno</application>.
   <application>Gataxx</application>, however, begins at the corners,
   rather than at the center of the board, and has slightly different
   rules for adding and moving discs.
  </para>

  <para>
   To run <application>Gataxx</application>, select
   <guimenuitem>Gataxx</guimenuitem> from the
   <guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
   Menu</guimenu>, or type <command>gataxx</command> on the
   command line. 
  </para>

  <para>
   <application>Gataxx</application> is included in the
   <filename>GNOME-games</filename> package, which is part of the
   GNOME desktop environment. This document describes version
   &version; of <application>Gataxx</application>.

 <!-- ================ Usage ================================ -->
 <!-- This section should describe basic usage of the application. -->

  <sect1 id="usage">
    <title>Playing Gataxx</title>
    <para>
      The basic rules of <application>Gataxx</application> are quite
      easy to learn, especially if you are familiar with other
      disc-flipping games.  The object of the game is to have more
      discs of your color on the board than your opponent does.  The
      game ends when the board is full or when one player has no discs
      at all on the board.
    </para>
    <para>
      Although <application>Gataxx</application> is a two player game,
      one or both players can be controlled by the computer.
  </para>


  <!-- ========= Basic Usage =========================== -->
  <sect2 id="mainwin">
   <title>Basic usage</title>
   <para>
    Starting <application>Gataxx</application> presents you with the
    <interface>game board</interface>, which is seven squares on a
    side.  You can start a game by selecting <guimenuitem>New
    Game</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Game</guimenu> menu.  A new
    game is shown in <xref linkend="mainwindow-fig">.

  <!-- ========= Rulez =========================== -->

    <sect2 id="rules"> 
      <title>Basic Rules</title>
      <para>
        A game of <application>Gataxx</application> begins with four
        pieces on the board: a dark colored piece in the upper left
        and lower right corners, and a light colored piece in the
        lower left and upper right corners.  Dark moves first; by
        default, this player is human.
      </para>
      <para>
        To make a move, click on one of your discs.  Available moves
        for that disc will be outlined in white.  For a disc in the
        middle of an unobstructed board, there are 24 possible moves,
        illustrated in <xref linkend="moves-fig">.  Click on one of
        the eight squares adjacent to the disc and you will add a new
        disc to the board.  Click on one further away, and the disc
        will move there, jumping any obstacles in its path.  You
        cannot move a disc into an occupied square, nor can you remove
        a disc from the board.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you move or add a disc to a position adjacent to one or
        more of your opponent's discs, you capture those discs.  When
        you capture them they change color to indicate your
        possession, and you can move them or add discs next to them as
        you would any other disc in your possession.  This is good for
        you and bad for your opponent.
      </para>
      <para>
        This means that, strategically, an L-shaped formation of discs
        is bad to have, because it allows an opponent to capture more
        discs with a single move.  The worst sort of formation would
        be donut-shaped, because it would allow the
        capture of eight pieces at once.
      </para>
