<bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
<para>
Cards in Tableau can be built either up or down in suit.  However, each
pile must follow only one of these rules.  For example, if a Tableau
pile has a three of clubs over a two of clubs, one can only play a four
of clubs on this pile.  Any available card can be played on to an empty
Tableau pile.
</para>
<para>
Foundation piles are to be built in suit from Ace to King, followed by
another King, then back down to Ace, giving 26 cards per pile when game
is won.  Cards in Foundation piles are no longer in play.
</para>
<para>
Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste.  Top card of
Waste is available for play.  There is no redeal.

<bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
<para>
A string of beads can be added to from both ends, and so should your
piles.  Make good use of any empty slots to append cards.  With a little
perseverance, this game can be a lot of fun!
