of each pile is in play.  However, to fascilitate play, a whole pile can
be moved to an appropriate Foundation with one drag.  Double clicking on

possible.

<bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
<para>
There are very few second chances in the real world, so use them when
you find them.  Chances are you will need to use the second deal to win
this game.  Remember where the key cards are and you'll be glad you
did.
