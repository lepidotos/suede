    To remove all cards except the four Aces.
  </para>
  <bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Aces are high cards.  When two cards of the same suit are available,
    the one with the lower rank can be removed.  When an empty slot
    appears, it can be filled with an group of cards.

  <bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
  <para>
    There is no reason to have an empty slot when dealing another batch
    of cards.  However, when you have an empty slot, try to keep it
    empty as long as possible, as this is a great way to get rid of
    buried cards.
