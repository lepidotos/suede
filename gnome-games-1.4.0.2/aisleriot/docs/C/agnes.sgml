            wrapping from King to Ace when necessary.  One card is dealt

            Seven piles.  Deal card face up in first pile.  Place one
            card face down on all other piles.  Place one card face up
            on next pile followed by one card face down on all the
            covered piles.  Repeat until there are seven cards in last
            pile.  Tableau can be built down in same colors.  Groups of
            cards can be moved.  Empty piles can only be filled by the
            next deal from the Foundation.

  <bridgehead>Goal</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Move all cards to the Foundation piles.
  </para>
  <bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color.  Groups of cards
    in sequence and same color can be moved as a unit.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the
    Tableau.  There are no redeals.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit in sequence, wrapping from King to
    Ace when necessary.  Cards in Foundations are still in play.  Double
    clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate
    Foundation pile if such a move is possible.

  </para>
  <para>
    Maximum possible score:  52
  </para>
  <bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Try to build down in suit whenever possible.  Try to score as many
    points as you can as this game is very hard to win.
