<bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
<para>
Any card of the suit in the first Foundation can be played on to this
Foundation pile at any time. Each ensuing Foundation can only be
started with a card of the same rank as this first card.  Once
started, these latter foundations can be built on in suit as long as a
card of the same rank already exists in the Foundation directly above
it.  Play cards from Reserves whenever possible following these rules.
</para>
<para>
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually.  Top card in
Waste is in play.  When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to
the Stock, maintaining order.  You can go through the deck three times.

<bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
<para>
It's no coincidence that solitaire games are also known as "patience
games."  Do not automatically put first available card on the second
(and third) foundation piles.  Sometimes it is worth using a different
suit so as to free up more cards in the Reserves.
