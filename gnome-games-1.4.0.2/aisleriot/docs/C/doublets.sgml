	    Seven piles, forming an arch shape (upside down U) to the
	    right.  Deal one card face up on each pile.  During this
	    deal, if a King is dealt, remove the King and place it on
	    the bottom of the deck.  Deal another card into this pile.
	    Each Reserve pile can only hold one card.  When a Reserve
	    pile is empty, it is automatically filled by the Waste, or,
	    if the Waste is empty, from the Stock.  Once original deal
	    is over, when a King is placed in a pile of the Reserve,
	    this pile is frozen as Kings cannot be moved.

    are eleven and twelve, in that order.  If the doubled number exceeds
    thirteen, subtract thirteen to find next needed card.  The series
