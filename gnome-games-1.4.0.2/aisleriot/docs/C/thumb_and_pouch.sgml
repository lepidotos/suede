  <bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by any suit but own.  Groups of
    cards can be moved.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
    a any legal sequence of cards.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped from the stock to the Waste individually.  Top
    card in Waste is in play.  When Stock is empty, move all cards in
    Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the
    deck three times.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move
    it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
  </para>
