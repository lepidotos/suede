  <bridgehead>Goal</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Move all cards to Foundation piles.
  </para>
  <bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Cards in Tableau are built down regardless of suit.  Kings can be
    placed on Aces.  Cards can only be moved singly.  Any available card
    can be played on an empty Tableau pile.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each Foundation pile must be started with a card the same rank as
    the base card.  Foundation piles are to be built up in suit from
    base card, playing Aces on top of Kings if necessary.  Cards in
    Foundation piles are no longer in play.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped singly from Stock to Waste.  Top card of Waste
    pile is always available for play.  There are no redeals.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Scoring</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Each card in Foundation piles scores one point.
  </para>
  <para>
    Maximum possible score:  52
  </para>
  <bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Hidden treasures are wonderful things, but only if you know they are
    there.  Keep track of what cards are in which piles as this
    information will probably come in handy.
