  <para>
    Remove all cards.
  </para>
  <bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Clicking on the Stock will deal one card to each of the Tableau
    piles.  If any of the cards showing in the Tableau are of the same
    rank, move the others on to the leftmost of the like cards.  Empty
    piles can only be filled by an ensuing deal from Stock.
  </para>
  <para>
    If at any point, all four cards showing are the same rank, they are
    removed.
  </para>
  <para>
    When Stock is empty, the Tableau piles are gathered, right pile on
    left, and placed back into stock.  The first card dealt will always
    be the first card dealt until it is removed.  There are unlimited
    redeals.
