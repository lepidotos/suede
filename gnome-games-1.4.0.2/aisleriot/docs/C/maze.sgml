      <entry>Fifty-four spaces in six rows of nine each. Deal cards into
        spaces one to eight. Leave space nine blank. Deal cards into spaces
        ten to seventeen. Leave space eighteen blank. Deal the remaining
        cards similarly. Then remove all the kings (which play no further 
        part in the game), so that six empty spaces remain in total. Any 
        card can be moved into a space to the left of another card of the 
        same suit and face value one one higher. Any card can be moved 
        into a space to the right of another card of the same suit and 
        face value one lower. An ace may be moved to the right of a
	queen or in the top left space. A queen may be moved to the left
	of an ace or in the bottom right space.

  <bridgehead>Goal</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Put each suit of cards into ascending order, with an ace in the
    top left corner, to create a run of cards: Ace to Queen of one suit, 
    Ace to Queen of another, Ace to Queen of the third, Ace to Queen
    of the fourth.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Cards are moved singly. Any card can be moved into a space to the 
    left of another card of face value one higher in the same suit. Any
    card can be moved into a space to the right of another card of face
    value one lower in the same suit.  An ace may be moved to the right
    of a queen or in the top left space. A queen may be moved to the left
    of an ace or in the bottom right space. 
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Scoring</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Each card placed next to another card of the same suit in the
    correct order scores one point.
  </para>
  <para>
    Maximum possible score:  48
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
  <para>
    Multiple adjacent spaces enable you to generate long sequences of
    cards. Beware of getting trapped into a situation where you move
    one card endlessly between two points.
