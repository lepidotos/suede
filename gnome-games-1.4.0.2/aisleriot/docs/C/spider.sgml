Ten piles.  Four piles (piles 1, 4, 7, and 10) get dealt 5
cards down and one card up while rest of the piles get dealt 4 cards
down and one card up.  Cards can be built down regardless of suit.
Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit.  Empty piles
can be filled with any card or movable unit.</entry></row>

<bridgehead>Goal</bridgehead>
<para>
To have eight sequences of cards (two for each suit) going down from King
down to Ace.
</para>
<bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
<para>
Build down regardless of suit.  Sequences of cards in the same suit can
be moved as a unit.  Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal
sequence.
</para>
<para>
Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every
pile.  However, all piles must be non-empty.  If an empty pile exists,
an error message will appear.
</para>
<para>
The Foundation piles are there for your convenience only.  When a
sequence of thirteen cards (from King to Ace in one suit) exists, it can
be moved to an empty Foundation pile.  Once there, these cards are no
longer in play.
