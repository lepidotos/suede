Move all cards on to Foundations.

<bridgehead>Rules</bridgehead>
<para>
Build on to Foundations by ones, twos, threes, and fours for piles
one, two, three, and four respectively.  Cards are dealt singly in to
the Waste from the Stock.  However, as the Waste pile can only hold
one card, this card must immediately be played on to a Foundation pile
or on to any of the four Reserve piles.  Cards in the Reserve piles
cannot be rearranged.

<bridgehead>Strategy</bridgehead>
<para>
Hone your skills for this game.  Luck will not get you very far here.
Try not to cover cards you might need sooner.  Consider saving a
column just for kings (as they are the last card to be played on each
Foundation).
