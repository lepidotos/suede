TODO -- (roughly in order of importance)
~~~~
integrate the game with gnome/gtk+-guile:  This will help us add hooks
to the game to allow a game-sensitive menu.  It will also allow us
make a preferences dialog for solitaire games. *DONE without using 
gnome/gtk+-guile*

add undo:  This will probably be done scheme side, and will require
modifying all of the games.  It will also make writing games a bit
more complicated. *DONE*

redo the card format:  I'm thinking of making a dynamic library
format.  This needs more thought.  I would like to have dynamic cards
at some point (ala microsoft solitaire) with moving backgrounds,
possibly.  Nothing really fancy, but good eye-candy anyway.

Add a preferences dialog to the game:  Not exciting but necessary.
Should allow the user to set the background, card/back pictures, and
toolbar properties.

Add a timer:  And add hooks to sol.scm to handle it. *DONE* (all in C)

Add the help browser:  And set up a system to let card games add their 
own help info. *DONE*

Scan the directory for solitaire games: *DONE*

Have the right mouse button show the card completely if it's partially
exposed. *DONE*

People have requested a search for card feature...  Dunno if it's
actually useful.

People have also requested Statistics.  That way it'll keep track of
how many games you've played. etc.

Add a splash screen while starting up. *DONE*

And finally, if a stack is getting too long, try compressing it.

Release Aisleriot 1.0  (:

EXTRAS:

Improve guile error trapping (ie add some!!)

Implement animation of moves made automatically within scheme code.
