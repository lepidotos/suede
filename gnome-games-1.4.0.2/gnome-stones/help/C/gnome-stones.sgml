   <!-- For this app, one could put "proving" or "edit" (probably even both
   of them) as sect2's seperate from the main window section. Since they

    <para>
      You play a little guy who is trapped in a cave, you must move around the
      cave tunelling through the ground looking for the exit. As you tunnel you
      have to collect the gemstones (diamonds to be precise) and avoid being
      squashed by falling rocks. In some levels, your task is to move
      strategically placed boxes into 'holes'.

   <title>Cave game</title> 
   <para> 
     This game has simple gravity physics, if you dig underneath a rock (or 
     diamond) then the object will fall down and if a rock squash you. But if 
     you do not linger underneath the rock then you are 
     unlikely to be squashed, but sometimes gravity can cause a chain 
     reaction in which a large number of rocks fall down and squash you. 
     If you get squashed you die and have to begin the level at the 
     beginning again.  You can push rocks out of the way if there is room 
     on the other side of them. To push a rock out of the way just walk 
     up to the rock and continue moving in the desired direction. The rock 
     will move if possible. If two rocks are next to each other horizontally 
     you can't move either of them. You are up against the clock in this 
     game. You can only find the exit (blinking square) after you have collecte     d enough diamonds, the number of diamonds you have not yet collected is sh     own in the statusbar as Diamond: (number of diamonds left)
   </para>
   <para>On some levels there are monsters that can freely move about the leve.         If these make contact with you, you die and you must restart.

     In this version of the game your task is to move strategically placed 
     crates or blocks into holes (hollow red squares), you move the crates
     in a similar way to rocks except there is no gravity acting in this 
     environment. Once you have slided all your blocks into the required 
     positions you move onto the next level. You are up against the clock 
     in this game. This game type is based on xsokoban and sokoban
