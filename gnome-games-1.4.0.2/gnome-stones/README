This is a quick and dirty README file.


Gnome-Stones keys:
==================

In the title-screen:
* [UP] and [DOWN] key to select the starting cave.
* [RETURN] or Game/New to start game.

While playing:
* Cursor keys to move the game figure.
* [Shift]+Cursor key, to dig the sand near the game figure, but don't move it.
* [p] key to pause the game.
* [ESC] key to kill the figure.
* [Shift]+[ESC] to abort game.


Gnome-Stone caves:
==================

The default caves are intended for debugging, but not for real playing. The
general structure of a caves file is the following:

[General] section:
------------------
* Title: (translated string, mandatory)
	Is the name of this game.

* Object size: (integer, mandatory, has to be 1 right now)
	How many characters does an object take in the cave description
	
* New life score: (integer, optional, default 500)

* Lives: (integer, optional, default 3)
	The number of lives, that you start with 
	
* Frame rate: (float, optional, default 0.2)
	The game is updated every "Frame rate" second

* Plugins: (string, mandatory)
	This is a colon sperated list of object plugins, that this cave file
	needs.  There must be one plugin named "default". Other object plugins 
	are "gnome-stones" and "gnomekoban".  Most likely this entry will look
	like default:gnome-stones, because gnomekoban isn't working right know.

[Objects] section:
------------------

The [Objects] section consists of lines of the form:

<character>=<plugin>:<object>[,<start value>

For example, if you have the following line

O=gnome-stones:boulder

than every 'O' in a Line## line in a cave section will be replaces with a boulder
object from the gnome-stones plugin in that cave.  There is one exception: if 
you use a underscore character here, you have to use a space character in the
Line## lines.

[Caves] section:
----------------
* Number: (integer, mandatory)
	Number of caves in this caves section.

* Cave###: (string, mandatory)
	Name of the ###th cave. Every cave in this cave file must
	be listed here.
	

[Start caves] section:
----------------------
* Number: (integer, mandatory)
	Number of start caves in this Start caves section. 
    
* Cave###: (string, mandatory)
	Name of the ###th start cave. A start cave is a cave, that you can start
	the game with.


Cave sections:
--------------

* Diamonds needed: (integer, mandatory)
	The number of diamonds, that are needed to open the exit.

* Diamond score: (integer, optional, default ?)
	The score you gain for the first 'Diamonds needed' diamonds.

* Extra: diamond score (integer, option, default 'Diamond score')
	The score you gain for every diamond, if the door has opened.

* Time: (integer, mandatory)
	The time you have to exit this cave.

* Message: (translated string, optional)
	This message is shown in the status-bar while playing this cave.

* Next cave: (string, optional)
	The name of the cave, that will be started after finishing this one.
	If no 'Next	cave' is given, this cave will be the last in the game.

* Height: (integer, mandatory)
* Width: (integer, mandatory)
	Size of this cave. The maximum size of cave is: 40 rows and 80 columns.

* Line##: (string, mandatory)
	For every row there must be a Line## line, which describes the content
	of this cave row. Every Line## line must have at least 'Width'
	characters. Every character symbolizes one object.

There may have additional options in the Cave sections, that depend one the
plugins loaded.  When using the gnome-stones object plugin, you can use the 
following options:
	
* gnome-stones:magic wall:millingTime: (integer, optional, default 0)
	The time, that the magic wall mills.

* gnome-stones:amoeba:slowTime: (integer, optional, default 0)
	The time, that the amoeba grows slowly. After this time, the
	amoeba will speed up growing

* gnome-stones:amoeba:maxSize: (integer, optional, default 200)
	If the amoeba grow larger than this size, it will transform to
	boulders.


For a better understanding of the game file format, you should have a close
look on the cave file that come with gnome-stones.  If you have created some
nice gnome-stones caves, just go ahead and send them to me.  I'll propably
create a web page, where I collect all the caves.
