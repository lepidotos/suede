	* help/C/topic.dat: Fixed
	  er - I was being dumb below.  The menu item is now

	  up the help doc okay, but we should change the call
	  to list Help with the pretty logo instead of just
	  listing 'mahjong'.  We also need to hook up a Help
	  button in the preferences dialog.  I have to run
	  now, so this will have to wait until later.

2000-09-13  Eric Baudais  <baudais@okstate.edu>

	instead of gnome_canvas_set_size().

1998-11-19  Francisco Bustamante <pancho@nuclecu.unam.mx>
	* mahjongg.c: Changing the map works now. Memory leaking is
	greatly reduced because images are destroyed after use. Changed
	gnome_dialog_set_modal (or whatever) to
	gtk_window_set_modal. Changing the tile images works
	too. Compiling warnings are gone. Most warnings during the game
	are gone too. Upped version to 0.99.1
	
1998-11-15  Francisco Bustamante <pancho@nuclecu.unam.mx>
	* mahjongg.c: All the tile drawing is now done by
	gnome-canvas. The code is somewhat cleaner, and the redraws are
	definitely better. TODO: make changing map and changing tile
	images work. When you use gnome_canvas_item_set to change the
	image, do we need to destroy the old image? Version 0.99.0
	* default.png: Someone did something to the transparent parts of
	the image, so I put them again. This is to make tiles nicer.
	
1998-11-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* mahjongg.c: Calculate x and y offsets to place tiles in the
	center of the playfield (AREA_WIDTH x AREA_HEIGHT).  Calculate new 
	values every time the map changes.

1998-26-28  Erik Troan  <ewt@redhat.com>

Mon May 11 21:05:50 EDT 1998  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@mit.edu>
	* default.xpm:  Was less brain-dead and changed the highlighted dragon
