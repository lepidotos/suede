	* gdk-card-image.c: Deal with errors and missing files/directories
	  correctly.  Use gnome-mime instead of g_is_image_filename to
	  avoid warning.

	* Makefile.am (cardbackdir): limited the number of cards available
	for small and medium suit vals.
	* gdk-card-image.c: as above.
	(make_suit): remove small image from joker -- just 2 black jokers
	and 2 red jokers instead.

	* gdk-card-image.c (gdk_imlib_rotate_image_180): Small fix to the
	new imlib api.  This should not be poking with Imlib internals in
	the first place.

	* Suits.xpm, Pictures.xpm: New xpms for the cards
