2001-03-14  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gnomecard.c: use TRASH icon instead of CLOSE for Delete.

2001-03-04  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* deladdrlist.c, emaillist.c, phonelist.c: added some missing _().

	changed

	* Add "Last Name" as sort criterion

	(Patch from james@and.org; fixes Bug #13898)

2000-07-28  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* address-conduit-capplet.desktop & gnomecard.desktop:
		Added the Turkish desktop entries.

2000-05-25  Tim Mooney     <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu>

	* dialog.c (gnomecard_prop_apply): Use gtk+ accessor to get value as an
	integer (rather than accessing internal data directly); eliminates
	compiler warning on some platforms, fixes Bug #12050

2000-05-14  Andreas Hyden  <a.hyden@cyberpoint.se>

	* address-conduit-capplet.desktop: Added Swedish translation.

2000-05-04  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_init): set the default icon

2000-05-02  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (panelConduitsdir): put the conduit dentries in the panel's
	Settings dir since the panel is lame like that
	(panelConduitsdir): move these files up a directory

	* address-conduit-capplet.desktop (Icon): use the gnomecard icon

2000-03-29  Russell Steinthal  <rms39@columbia.edu>

	* dialog.c: Add version number to about box and update copyright date

2000-03-30  Christopher R. Gabriel  <cgabriel@firenze.linux.it>
	
	* address-conduit-capplet.desktop: Added italian translation
	* gnomecard.desktop: Likewise

2000-03-12  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address_conduit.c: Change conduit name to be more eye pleasing.

2000-03-12  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <deity@eskil.dk>

	* address-conduit-capplet.c (main): Uses new libgpilotdcm.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): juju to make .conduit file.

2000-02-27  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address-conduit-capplet.c: Update to new signature of 
	gnome_pilot_client_get_pilots function

	* address-conduit.[ch]: Mark pilot-deleted records to be ignored
	during iteration.

2000-02-26  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address-conduit.c: Fix "email" bug were all cell and pager phone
	#'s appea as email address. Thanks to Alan Shutko for the patch.

	* address-conduit-capplet.c: Don't include dummy callback header
	file which is unecessary now. 

2000-02-21  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* card.c (strtoCardRev): Fix reading REV in short format "YYYYMMDD".
	It should addjust year by 1900 and month by 1 before storing 
	in tm structure.

2000-02-16  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>
 
 	* dialog.c (gnomecard_prop_apply): Update REV property when the
 	record is changed.
 
 	* card.c (strtoCardRev): Should store year-1900 in struct tm.
 	(card_rev_str): New function.

2000-02-16  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address-conduit-capplet.c, address-conduit.[ch]: Rearange some code.
	Move the load/save/copy config functions out of the header file and into
	the capplet. Conduit only needs a specialized load_config function that
	generates an error if config is not found.

	* address-conduit.c: Add support for REV attribute. Check if it is set
	and is later than last sync to determine if the record has been Modified.
	
2000-02-08  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <deity@eskil.dk>

	* address-conduit.c: Missing symbol gpc fixed.

2000-02-02  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <deity@eskil.dk>

	* address-conduit-capplet.c : Uses the new libgpilotd

2000-01-17  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address-conduit.[hc]: Update to use gpilotd_get_pilot_basedir
	and gnome_pilot_conduit_standard_abs_set_db_open_mode.

	* address-conduit-capplet.c: Added pilotID argument to 
	gpilotd_conduit_mgmt_new.

2000-01-05  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <deity@eskil.dk>

	* Makefile.am: Applied Colin Walters <levanti@verbum.org> patch
	for debian compiles.

2000-01-03  Ray Lee <rblee@impulse.net>
	
	* card.c (get_CardProperty): Use a separate object, as the macro
	"has" has side effects.  

1999-12-31  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* card.c: Fix infinite file growth problems, by not adding
	the same attribute to the vcard property more than once.

	* address-conduit.[ch]: Remove custom \n escaping and always
	use QUOTED-PRINTABLE when necessary because libversit has been
	fixed appropriately. Also remove various compiler warnings.

1999-12-17  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address-conduit.c: Fix \n escaping again.  Thanks to Patrick Decowski
	for proding and patch.

1999-12-11  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address-conduit.c: Do our own \n escaping. Perhaps in future
	we'll switch back to using QUOTED-PRINTABLE, but currently gnomecard
	just doesn't handle it well. The appropriate places are ifdefed.

1999-12-08  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address-conduit.c (compare) : fix logic for null
	entries.

1999-12-04  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <deity@eskil.dk>

	* Makefile.am (libaddress_conduit_la_SOURCES): added
	address-conduit.h, also added the .desktop to EXTRA_DIST.

1999-12-04  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* gnome-gnomecard.png: Added this icon (better than the small XPM).

1999-12-01  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address-conduit.c : If local store is empty then force a slow sync.  
	Store a backup of gcrd file before overwriting it during the sync.  
	If any address elements contain newlines, set enconding	to 
	ENC_QUOTED_PRINTABLE. This makes such addresses load with gnomecard ok, 
	although it might not be displayed perfectly, since gnomecard has a 
	real limitation for handling newlines in fields	other than comment.

1999-11-21  Vadim Strizhevsky  <vadim@optonline.net>

	* address-conduit* : Added first version gnome-pilot conduit for gnomecard.
	The initial version reads/writes directly to gcrd file because 
	current idl is not good enough. In future, when CORBA interface is improved
	to the GnomCal's level it will be used instead.
	
1999-10-22  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.c: Added static clauses to new functions.

	* card.c: We now support extended attributes and properties. Show
         property types in card_to_string where needed.

1999-10-10  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: Fixed top window policy. The canvas goes now under a
	scrolled window.
	* card.c: added card_to_string to make the PLAIN_TEXT drop and the
	canvas view more informative.
	 Also, simplified Martin Baulig's change.
	* canvas.c: Canvas view is more informative now. Changed almost all 
	canvas fonts to lucidatypewriter. Beautified.
	* dialog.c: Beautified setup dialog.
	* del.c: Elliminated 'erase last' bug.
	* BUGS file added.

1999-10-03  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* emaillist.c: URL entry was not updated when loading crd data into
	widgets. fixed.

1999-09-27  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* card.c (card_create_from_vobject): Check for vObjectValueType ()
	before calling str_val () to avoid a coredump on empty fields.
	This fixes bug #1260.

1999-09-20  Eskil Olsen <deity@eskil.dk>
	
	* makefile.am: libversit.a -> libversit.la

1999-09-09  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* emaillist.c, deladdrlist.c, phonelist.c: up/down buttons call
	property_box_changed.
	* list.c, dialog.c, columnhdrs.c, columnhdrs.h: Property dialog and
	clist now accept multiple phones and emails. Deleted unnecesary 
	COLTYPEs.
	* canvas.c: canvas_update: email text was not being cleaned when 
	there was no email for the current record. fixed.
	* gnomecard.desktop: Use "Address Book" instead of "GnomeCard".

1999-09-05  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* emaillist.c, dialog.c: Now for the e-mail addresses (finally
	multiple e-mail addresses) and moved URL entry to the new "Internet"
	section.
	* dialog.c, dialog.h: Birth Date is back!

1999-09-02  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>
	* deladdrlist.c: Similar interfase for addresses (whee!!).
	* card.[hc]: We're back to original data structures!

1999-09-01  David Kaelbling <drk@sgi.com>

	* card.c (strtoCardRev): Off by one error fix.

1999-07-15  Herbert Valerio Riedel  <hvr@hvrlab.dhs.org>

	* phonelist.c, list.c, addresslist.c: code/cast cleanup
	* list.h: added gnomecard_list_remove_card() proto

1999-05-04  Eric S. Raymond  <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>

	* canvas.c card.c card.h cardtypes.h dialog.c dialog.h pairs.h:
	Added handling of a Categories field, corresponding to the vcard
	CATEGORIES entity; it is editable (in the Explanatory tab) and is
	properly read from and saved to gnome-card files.  Someday soon
	this should be used to capture Palm Pilot address categories.

1999-05-04  Russell Steinthal  <rms39@columbia.edu>

	* dialog.c: Added calls to gnome_config_sync() after existing
	calls to gnome_config_set_*()- now the config values are actually
	written to disk, so we have persistent column definitions, search
	strings, etc.

1999-04-10  Jesse Sightler <jsight@pair.com>

	* gnomecard.gnorba: Fixed minor typos.

1999-04-10  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* help/C/Makefile.am: Make documentation generation work when
	srcdir != builddir. Stolen from gnome-libs. Can someone check that
	it still works when srcdir = buildir?

1999-04-03  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_init): Fixed toolbar not appearing
	every-other execution.
	* phonelist.c: Total re-write. The interfase now goes acording to
	the idea of the program. Similar interfases will be coded for e-mail
	and delivery addresses.

1999-03-27  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_set): Now, up to the ten last saves
	are put in backups until the 'Save' bug is fixed.
	* dialog.c (gnomecard_save): Tell when there was an error during
	save.
	* del.c (gnomecard_delete_current_card): Use g_return_if_fail,
	call gnomecard_set_changed.
	* card.c (card_convert_to_vobject): An aptempt to eliminate YA
	save bug.
	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_set_app_title), dialog.c 
	(gnomecard_append_file): Now the currently opened file is displayed.
	* gnomecard.c (filemenu), dialog.c (gnomecard_open_default): special
	menu option to explicitly open the default file, avoiding the need
	to go to ~/.gnome/ and open GnomeCard.gcrd.
	* Some interfase fixes.

1999-02-27  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@adam.kaist.ac.kr>

	* canvas.c (*_FONTSET): Added Korean fonts to the each fontset
	strings.

1999-02-26  Sergey Panov  <sipan@mit.edu>

        * canvas.c (gnomecard_canvas_new): Safer way of using fontsets
        in canvas text items.

1999-02-24  Arturo Espinosa  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* fixed bug http://bugs.gnome.org/db/30/304.html reported by
	  Maneesh Sahani. Canvas buglet.

1999-02-23  Carsten Schaar  <nhadcasc@fs-maphy.uni-hannover.de>

	* sort.h: Made 'gnomecard_sort_col' declaration extern.

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_destroy_cards): Fixed an error, that
 	occured, when a translated text was longer than the original one.

1999-02-17  Sergey Panov  <sipan@mit.edu>

        * canvas.c (gnomecard_canvas_new): Instead of giving "font"
        gnome_canvas_item_new we use gdk_fontset_load to create
        pointers to GdkFont and feed them to gnome_canvas_item_new
        using "font_gdk" 
       

1999-02-14  Sergey Panov  <sipan@mit.edu>

	* gnomecard.c: added bindtextdomain call, so that *.mo 
	files can be found. Use _() macro for two more dialogs

	* columnhdrs.c: Use _() macro for column_hdrs[i].colname

	* dialog.c: Use _() macro for column_hdrs[i].colname
	and button labels

	* canvas.c: Use _() macro in canvas. Removed foundry and encoding
	from the font definitions, so that "cronyx" fonts and other fonts
	with other then iso8859-1 encoding can be used. (I doubt that fonts
	should be hardcoded)
	
1999-02-09  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* addresslist.c, phonelist.c: Added _()'s to get radiobtns translated.

1999-02-08  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* gnomecard.c: Remove the evil gtk_widget_realize call, main problem
	fixed in gnomelibs.

1999-02-07  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (gnomecard_update_canvas): fixed workphone not being cleared
	when it whould and a comma appearing in the addresses display.
	The header boxes now resize depending on the length of the fname.
	This looks nicer. Canvas bug workarround (fname label is not centered
	now).

1999-02-07  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* gnomecard.c: Realize the main window before showing it makes fvwm
	happier... Also removed a define 'SEC' which isn't used and conflicts
	with system includes...

1999-02-06  Lauris Kaplinski <lauris@ariman.ee>

	* gnomecard.desktop: Added Estonian translations.

1999-02-06  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@adam.kaist.ac.kr>

	* gnomecard.desktop: Added Korean translations.

1999-02-04  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Replaced
	$(prefix)/etc/CORBA/servers by $(sysconfdir)/CORBA/servers, as
	suggested by Phillipe Defert (Philippe.Defert@cern.ch).

1999-01-31  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (gnomecard_canvas_new): Make the canvas with the
	display also a drag source for the cards.

	* card.c (card_save): Memory leak fix.
	(card_load): Leak fix.

	* list.c (drag_data_get): Add drag and drop support for various
	types: application/x-vcard; text/plain and x-application/x-email

1999-01-31  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	Added help files for default language.

1999-01-31  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (gnomecard_clear_canvas): Implemented.
	* gnomecard.c: bug fixes. Changed "Merge" to "Append" until we implement
    merging.
	* dialog.c (gnomecard_append_call): call gnomecard_set_changed if append
 	  was successful.

1999-01-20  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* dialog.c (gnomecard_edit): Connect the help signal of the
 	GnomePropertyBox to gnome_help_pbox_display.
	(gnomecard_setup): Likewise.

1999-01-20  Arturo Espinosa <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	Bug fixing. Doesn't SIGSEGV when changing the cols order with an
        empty file. There is a default filename now used, avoiding SIGSEGV
	when trying to save in a special case. "New file" was deleted from
	the toolbar to avoid confusions.

1999-01-17  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_init): Don't use the appbar progress meter.

1999-01-08  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_init): Create an Appbar.  Install menu
 	hints.

	Updated the menus to adhere to the standard.

1998-12-10 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* addresslist.c, phonelist.c: fixed _connnect_ functions for changed
	entries in the form to use gtk_signal_connect(), not
	gtk_signal_connect_object().  Should fix problems with address and
	phone edit forms.

1998-12-03 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* addresslist.[ch], dialog.c, phonelist.[ch]: fixed bug where if you
	apply a given card multiple times, you get leaks and other fun memory
	misbehavior.
	
1998-11-30 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* gnomecard.c, canvas.c: added scrollbars to the canvas view of
	the current card. Added comment to end of view.
	
1998-11-30 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* gnomecard.c: changed so user can arbitrarily resize main app window
	* list.c: correctly handle selection changes in clist for master
	card list via kbd input

1998-11-29 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* canvas.c: completely initial attempt at having a complete
	card view presented via a canvas to the right side of the
	master card listing.

1998-11-29 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* changed sorting functions to use ColumnType as argument for
	column you want to sort by, not the actually sorting function.
	There are helper functions to map between ColumnType and sorting
	function.

	* started to rework the canvas display of the currently selected
	card. Still in early stages.

	* Column display editor is pretty complete, will store
	user configuration persistantly via gnome_config.

Sat Nov 28 22:58:10 1998  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomecard.c: remove right justify stuff

1998-11-26 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* many files: Column Header Editor almost working, so you can
	pick which columns are displayed in the master column list.

1998-11-19  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gnomecard.c (main): CORBA added...

1998-11-14 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * dialog.c, gnomecard.c, list.[ch], sort.c: changed
	gnomecard_rebuild_list() to not require user to pass
	currently selected card as an argument. Instead we just
	look in clist structure to determine currently selected
	card, and restore selection to this card after we rebuild
	list.

	Also moved majority of code which modifies the card list display
	into list.c. Next step is to made rest of code independent of
	the current global variable gnomecard_list.

1998-11-14 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * gnomecard.c, list.[ch]: added functions to create column
	titles and values based on user configuration of the
	columns they want shown in the master card list.

	Also added code to handle sorting by column when user clicks
	column title button at top of clist
	
1998-11-13 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* columnhdrs.[ch]: moved code to allow customization of
	column headers in main card view into these files.

	* other files: modified to use the new columnhdrs functions
	for building card list. Not complete yet...
	
1998-11-12  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* gnomecard.c: removed hpaned for now, had very funky behavior...
	
1998-11-11  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * gnomecard.c: fixed gnomecard_list to work with recent clist changes

	* phonelist.[ch]: moved code to handle phone list part fo
	card edit property box into a separate file. 

	* addresslist.[ch]: moved code to handle address list part fo
	card edit property box into a separate file. 

1998-11-11  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* dialog.c: beginings of phone number support

	The way the phone number and address types are handled will be
	changed soon - the current radio button to control the type is
	a kludge.

1998-11-11  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* sort.c: fixed sorting so it works again

	* dialog.c: changed gnomecard_prop_close to accept ptr to Card
	struct being editted argument instead of ptr to the GList element
	containing the card. This is because the order of cards in the
	gnomecard_crds GList can change after the user edits data and sorting
	criteria is applied, and the ptr to the GList element containing
	the card is not necessarily invariant.  Better to just pass a
	ptr to the Card itself anyways.
	
1998-11-10  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * list.c: Changed mechanism for determining relationship between
	a row in the gnomcard_list clist and the matching Card struct.
	We assign as row data for each row a ptr to the  Card struct.

	* gnomecard.c, dialog.c, del.c: Fixed so we can delete entries now.
	Replaced most of the code in del.c with a single function
	gnomecard_delete_current_card.

	* card.c: fixed card_free() to remove address structures properly
	
1998-11-10  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* card.[ch], pairs.h, cardtypes.h: Changed PROP_DELADDR to 
	PROP_POSTADDR

1998-11-10  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
        * card.[ch]: Changed how the postal address type is handled.
	Changed the name of several things to not include 'deladdr' in
	their name, which I found confusing. These are now 'postaddr'
	instead.
	
	* dialog.c:  I've made the addresses for a person a part of
	the main card editting property box.  Currently there more address
	types than I think are required. I want to eventually move to
	a system where the user can add an arbitrary number of address
	types beyond the default allowed.

	* gnomecard.c: I've made the dbl-click and right button click
	menus for an item insensitive if the item is already being
	editted.

1998-11-07  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* (many files):

	- have removed most of tree view code since now using list view
	  some routines remain (commented out) until I replace them
	  with list equivalents

	- noticed in card.c a nasty str_val() macro that depends upon
	  the a local variable being present! Will have to go through
	  and change all that (its in alot of places) because that
	  is just asking for a problem.

	
1998-11-04  Michael Fulbright <msf@redhat.com>
	* (many files): I wanted to summarize what I've been doing the
	past week:

	- moved to a list view instead of the tree view because it
	  seems most people feel this is the right way to go

	- moved address/phone/email dialogs into the main card edit
	  dialog.  I think it is best to have as much information
	  visible as possible so users can quickly find the information
	  they need.

	This has involved touching alot of the source code, but  
	I am reusing a great deal of the original code.

1998-10-25  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* del.c: Now you can delete the whole list of email addresses of a
	contact, his name, his birthday and a whole bunch of those. This
	needs refining.

1998-10-23  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.c: Modified structures to allow identification of every card
	property through piggybacking. Modifications all over the code to
	adapt to this.
	* del.c: Now you can delete individual e-mail entries. Eventualy, it
	should be possible to delete any item in any card.

1998-10-15  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (sortmenu) Changed GNOME_APP_UI_RADIOITEMS for
	GNOME_APP_UI_ITEM. This fixes the sort menu not showing.
		(helpmenu) Eliminated invalid entry.
	* dialog.c: Various gnomecard_append_file bug fixes. It should work
	right now.

1998-10-14  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* dialog.c: (gnomecard_edit) Fixed timezone marked as "used"
	when editting a card.

1998-09-26  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	The code of GnomeCard gets split (finally)!
        * Makefile.am: included all the new files.

1998-09-25  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_sort_by_fname, gnomecard_init): the column
	button just toggles the radio_menu_item of "sort by fname" to TRUE so 
	that the callback for that radio_menu_item executes the sorting.
	
1998-09-25  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: broke gnomecard_sort_cards into several functions.
	(gnomecard_open_file): now sorts the file when loading.
	(gnomecard_update_tree): now the card is relocated to its sorted 
		position.
	(gnomecard_cmp_names): new sorting function.	
	(gnomecard_cmp_emails): new sorting function.

1998-09-22  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

1998-08-09  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_find_card): oh, yes: the find utility is here.
		I'm using shell wilcard pattern matching (fnmatch) instead of regexps.
		BTW: any resemblance with Netscape's find utility is pure coincidence.

1998-08-08  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.[hc], gnomecard.c: CardDelAddr now uses an array of DELADDR_MAX
		char pointers, instead of using named structure members. It was
		getting pretty heary... how could one arrive to these situations?
		Where did common sense go?
	* cardfind.xpm, Makefile.am: new icon for find utility!
	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_find_card_call): getting ready for the find 
		utility	(to regexp or not to regexp?)

		the phone at the side of each card's root.

1998-08-06  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.c: fixed multi-line comment saving bug.
	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_add_dellabel): getting ready for
		handling delivery labels.

1998-08-06  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c (gnomecard_update_tree): node should initially point to
		the children of the crd->user_data.
		(main): Now using a hpaned for the app_contents (much nicer).
		(gnomecard_add_card_sections_to_tree): Phone numbers now show
			their properties in the same node as the number.
		(gnomecard_update_tree): e-mail address shown with the
			formatted name of each card.

1998-08-03  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Made the code use GtkCTreeNode instead of GList, for the new ctree.

	since the nodes are opaque structures now.

1998-07-31  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: Several GUI fixes and refinements.
	* card.c:      Fixed address save bug: should have used
		VCCityProp instead of VCLocationProp. Changed field name of 
		locality in CardDelAddr to city.

1998-07-25  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: You can add delivery addresses now.

1998-07-24  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnomecard.c: (viewmenu, gnomecard_toggle_.*_view) New menu for hiding
	and showing the canvas and the tree.

1998-07-19  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

  * gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_spawn_new) Now you can spawn another gnomecard
	from gnomecard. This will be useful as soon as I implement DND. gnomecard
  must be in your path.

	* gnomecard.c: (gnomecard_update_canvas) I'll add all the wysiwyg
	displaying functionality here. The card view now updates when
	the card is being editted and "Apply" is clicked.
		(gnomecard_destroy_cards) now checks for any blocked cards
		and shows an error if there are any, then returns FALSE.
		(gnomecard_cards_blocked) added.

1998-07-16  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* card.c: (card_geopos_str, card_timezn_str, card_bday_str) new 
		functions to help representing the information in the 
		interfase.
	* gnomecard.c: a couple of bug fixes (sigsegvs and functionality).
		I'm using gnome_canvas for the wysywyg view.
		Almost all the data of the card is represented in the
		tree now.
		New 'First' and 'Last' buttons.
		The tree view now uses solid lines and the scrollbars
		appear only if necessary. It also freezes while adding
		cards when loading.
	* addrtool.xpm: for future use.
	* last.xpm, next.xpm: the pixmaps for the corresponding buttons.
		Should these go with the stock?
	* org.xpm, exp.xpm: for the corresponding sections in the tree.

		       make my life easier in future development with 
		       gnomecard.
