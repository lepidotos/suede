BUG #1260

 Bug #1260 seems to be a problem with libversit's parser and gnomecard
 ignoring any extended properties. It is good to check the value type, but
 the error is still there.

 OK, this one is gone too.

Erase last bug (fixed).

 There is a nasty bug that happens when erasing the last card on the list.
 It seems like the clist row is erased, but the actual data erased is the
 card selected before the last one. I have observed this when modifying
 cards with an arbitrary location in the list too, but unable to reproduce
 the bug.

 Hah! This was fixed right away. The thing was that, as the card's row in the
 clist was being erased first, gnomecard_curr_crd was changed as a side
 effect, and then the card it pointed to was erased. This is why people 
 shouldn't ever use globals... and this program is full of them.
