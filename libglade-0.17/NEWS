libglade-0.17: 7-September-2001
	- use gtk_clist_set_column_title to set clist column titles
	  when possible so that they get the alignment of the column.
	- Backport code that cleans up widget hash table in the
	  GladeXML object on widget destruction.  This means that
	  glade_xml_get_widget() should always return a valid widget
	  or NULL.
	- Move headers to a a libglade-1.0/ subdirectory.  This is to
	  allow parallel installation of stable and development
	  versions of libglade.  Libraries depending on libglade will
	  probably need to be rebuilt so that their *-config scripts
	  contain the correct CPP flags.

libglade-0.16: 13-February-2001
	- GNOME-DB support contributed by David Marin Carreno.
	- various other bug fixes and a few memory leaks plugged.  See
	  changelog for details.

libglade-0.15: 22-November-2000
	- many bug fixes and memory leak plugs (me, Morten, Federico, others)
	- libglade now does `visible accel group' handling for
	  GnomeDruids as well.
	- Install pkg-config .pc files so that you can get libglade
	  cflags and libs through the pkg-config system as well.  Due
	  to a small bug in pkgconfig-0.4, these files cause a segfault :(
	- Updated bonobo support (Michael)
	- You now need to pass the --enable-bonobo flag to configure
	  to build with bonobo support.
	- small fix to headers so that they don't cause problems with
	  the C++ compiler in RH7.0.

libglade-0.14: 10-July-2000
	- radio menu item support (from patch by Mitch Chapman)
	- make accelerators visible in GtkPixmapMenuitems.
	- Added a glade_set_custom_handler to allow better control
	  over creation of `Custom' widgets.  This can be used by
	  language bindings or other applications that want more
	  control over custom widget handling.
	- add tearoff menu items to menus if gnome settings say that
	  they should be shown.
	- a few other bug fixes.

libglade-0.13: 20-May-2000
	- improved bonobo support from Michael Meeks.
	- building documentation doesn't require an X connection now.
	- accelerators for widgets on notebook pages are now only active
	  when the page is visible (Jon K Hellan).
	- memory leak fixes (Morten).

libglade-0.12: 13-March-2000
	- fixes for GtkHPaned/GtkVPaned.
	- handle progress bar attributes.
	- dock layout should save correctly now for GnomeApp widgets.
	- handle non stock menu icons in GNOME mode.
	- added glade_xml_get_widget_prefix() function to get all widgets
	  whose names start with a certain prefix.
	- added glade_xml_signal_connect_data() function that connects a
	  named signal and allows you to specify the data argument.  This
	  is a simple wrapper around glade_xml_signal_connect_full.
	- bonobo support from Michael Meeks.

libglade-0.11: 5-December-1999
	- fixed some more problems that would cause segfaults on some errors.
	- added support for GtkCalendar and GtkInputDialog.
	- added assertions to some functions to try to pick up more runtime
	  errors.

libglade-0.9:  20-November-1999
	- don't crash when creating a GtkPixmap widget if the pixmap file
	  couldn't be found, or the pixmap file was corrupt.
	- fixed bug with setting the window policy.  If you were using
	  libglade-0.8 and found you could not resize windows correctly, then
	  this bug should now be fixed.

libglade-0.8:  16-November-1999
	- fixed mem leak in the GtkLabel and GtkAccelLabel creation routines.
	  Also recognise the wrap property of these widgets.
	- fixed the code for removing placeholders in the tree, so it actually
	  works.
	- fixed the i18n stuff so it doesn't translate empty strings.
	- take notice of more of the settings on GnomeDruidPageStandard's.
	- don't depend on internal libxml structures.  This means that libxml
	  1.7.2 or greater is required, but libglade will be less likely to
	  break if Daniel changes the internal structures.
	- fixed recognition of GNOME_STOCK_PIXMAP_EXIT.
	- some justification fixes for some menu items.
	- correctly name GnomeDockItems
	- be more consistent with setting the properties of toplevel windows.
	  Also added support for the modal and default_width/default_height
	  properties.
	- test-libglade.c is now dual licenced under GPL and X style licence.
	  This clears up any problems with creating a non GPL/LGPL'd
	  application using test-libglade as a starting point.

libglade-0.7:  28-September-1999
	- Fixed a bug where libglade would seg fault when you tried to load
	  a file that did not exist or was not a valid XML file.  This bug
	  was found by Michael Meeks.
	- Fixed segfault when adding normal buttons to a GnomeDialog's action
	  area.  This fixes bug #2323.

libglade-0.6:  20-September-1999
	- libglade now honours the has_focus and has_default flags for
	  widgets.
	- The correct default for can_focus (false) is now used.  This was
	  found by Miguel.  It should prevent the segfaults caused by
	  infinite recursion some people were seeing.
	- Placeholders are removed from the interface as it gets parsed.  The
	  warnings were not really very useful, and there are times when you
	  want to leave some spaces blank (such as in tables).
	- Fixed bug with setting accelerators that have no modifiers.  This
	  one was found by Paul Clifford.

libglade-0.5:  7-September-1999
	- removed some stuff to do with glade-keys.c I missed in the last
	  release.
	- If a .glade file has been changed on disk since it was last loaded
	  by libglade, it is reparsed.  This should be helpful for libptb.
	- New function glade_xml_new_from_memory for building an interface
	  from an in memory buffer containing the XML file.
	- Better support for underline accelerators.  You can now set
	  underline accelerators on GtkLabel's, and get them to change focus
	  to another widget, click a button, or change the page on a notebook.
	- Added support for the GtkLayout, GnomeIconList, GnomeIconSelection,
	  GnomeDruid, GnomeDruidPageStart, GnomeDruidPageFinish,
	  GnomeDruidPageStandard, GnomePixmap and GnomePropertyBox widgets.

libglade-0.4:  24-August-1999
	- Use gdk_keyval_by_name instead of a local hash table for looking
	  up key values for accelerators.  This removes a big hash table
	  from libglade's overhead.
	- Radio buttons groups are really fixed this time.
	- Table column spacing is correctly interpreted now.
	- Support for the GtkPacker widget has been added.

libglade-0.3:  9-August-1999
	- Changed over to a SAX based XML parser.  This cuts down on memory
	  usage and increases speed a bit for the parser.  It also reduces
	  the number of malloc's and frees.
	- Better handling of accelerator keys, including underline accelerators
	  for menu items and buttons.
	- Miscelaneous bug fixes.

libglade-0.2:  20-June-1999
	- Radio group support
	- The start of gnome support -- this code has been split off into a
	  separate library called libglade-gnome.  You can get the cflags or
	  libraries to link with the gnome code by calling `libglade-config
	  --cflags --libs gnome`.  Also, if you want gnome support, you
	  should call glade_gnome_init() instead of glade_init().
	- I18N support.  Libglade can either use the current translation
	  domain when building the widget tree, or you can specify a
	  different one with glade_xml_new_with_domain().  There is also
	  a program called libglade-xgettext to help extract strings for
	  translation from an XML file.

libglade-0.1: 27-May-1999
	- Many fixes from many people.  This version should actually be
	  useable.
	- Now includes documentation.

libglade-0.0.3: 2-November-1998
	- Forgot to include makekeys.awk -- this may have caused problems
	  for some people.

libglade-0.0.2: 1-November-1998
	- Updated to work with the changes Daniel made to libxml.
	- Added support for keyboard accelerators.

libglade-0.0.1: 25-October-1998
	- Initial release
