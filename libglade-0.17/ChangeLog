	* configure.in: update configure script for autoconf 2.52

	* NEWS: add news items.

	* glade/glade-xml.c: fix up doc comments for
	glade_xml_{get,pop}_uline_accel so that they actually get
	extracted correctly.

2001-09-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* configure.in: increment version number.

	* doc/Makefile.am: copy build stuff from head branch, as it works
	better.  Also, get rid of the "if GNOME_SUPPORT" stuff.  The
	object scanning code doesn't need gnome support.

	* doc/libglade-docs.sgml: update the copyright years to reflect
	that it has had updates since 1999.  Also change documentation
	licence to GFDL.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (remove_data_func): we don't need the GladeXML
	object here.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (clist_build_children): special case GtkLabel
	column titles, using gtk_clist_set_column_title so that the title
	gets aligned appropriately.

2001-09-01  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (remove_data_func): don't remove the signal
	handler here.

	* libgladeConf.sh.in (LIBGLADE_INCLUDEDIR): change include dir.

	* libglade-config.in: change -I flag for --cflags

	* libglade*.pc.in (Cflags): adjust cflags for new header location.

	* glade/Makefile.am (gladeincludedir): install headers under a
	versioned directory.

	private structure.
	(*): use GQuarks when setting/getting data for a marginal speed
	improvement.
	(glade_xml_widget_destroy): function that cleans up dangling
	pointers inside the GladeXML object when a widget is destroyed.
	(glade_xml_set_common_params): connect up glade_xml_widget_destroy
	to each widget that gets constructed.
	(remove_data_func): function that removes data from a widget in
	the long name hash, and disconnects the destroy signal handler.
	(glade_xml_destroy): iterate through longname_hash with
	remove_data_func, to clean up signals.

2001-04-04  John Gotts  <jgotts@linuxsavvy.com>

	* libglade.spec.in: Fixed the Group:'s.  Also cleaned up the build
	process a bit.

2001-03-26  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* doc/.cvsignore: Ignore some more generated files.

2001-02-13  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade.h: add prototype for glade_gnome_db_init.

	* glade/glade-gnomedb.c (glade_gnome_db_init): accidentally forgot
	to initialise the gnome-db widgets :( -- cut and paste error.

2001-02-12  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* NEWS: added news items.

	* glade/glade-gnomedb.c: changed copyright notice for this file at
	author's request.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (toolbar_build_children): interpret active
	attribute.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (gnomedialog_build_children): translate the
	label if it is not a stock button.
	(toolbar_build_children): interpret the "active" attribute of
	toolbar toggle button children.  Based on patch from Byron
	Ellacott.

2001-02-10  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* libglade.m4 (module_args): recognise "gnomedb" addon library.

	* libglade-config.in (lib_gnomedb): add in rules to show gnomedb
	flags.

	* libglade-gnome.pc.in (Requires): libglade-gnome requires gnomeui
	-- this should correct the problem with this file.

	* libglade-gnomedb.pc.in: the pkg-config script for libglade-gnomedb.

	* Makefile.am (pkgconfig_DATA): install a gnomedb pkg-config data
	file if building gnome-db support.

	* glade/Makefile.am: add rules for gnomedb library and increment
	libtool version number.

	* configure.in: add gnome-db tests and update version number.

	* glade/glade-gnomedb.c: new file based on the gnomedb support
	contributed by David Marín Carreño <davefx@bigfoot.com>.

2000-11-29  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	A couple of memory leaks found by Morten:
	* glade/glade-bonobo.c (gnome_control_new): unref the control
	frame on error rather than destroying it.  Destroy doesn't unref,
	so we get a leak.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (pixmapmenuitem_new): free the filename of
	the icon file here.

2000-11-28  Jody Goldberg <jgoldberg@home.com>

	* configure.in : Use AM_PROG_LIBTOOL rather than AC_PROG_LIBTOOL

2000-11-22  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* NEWS: new news items.

	* configure.in: increment version number.

	* doc/Makefile.am (clean-local): small makefile fix.

	* configure.in: build .pc files from .pc.in files.

	* libglade-*.pc.in: pkg-config input files for various libglade
	components.  These ones cause a segfault in pkgconfig-0.4, due to
	a small bug.

	* configure.in (have_bonobo): modify check so that you must pass
	--enable-bonobo flag to get bonobo support.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_set_toplevel, glade_xml_destroy):
	pick up a GtkAccelGroup reference leak highlighted by Morten's
	last patch.

2000-11-21  Morten Welinder  <terra@diku.dk>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_destroy): Plug leak.

2000-11-08  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* doc/Makefile.am (scan): small fix to the docs directory makefile
	so that it will build with more recent gtkdoc's.

2000-11-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (druid_build_children): setup accel groups
	for the individual pages of the druid, similar to the property box
	and notebook widgets.

	* test-libglade.c (main): unref the GladeXML object before calling
	gtk_main.  This shouldn't cause any problems.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (messagebox_build_children): glade seems to
	use the stock_pixmap tag rather than stock_button now.
	(get_stock_name): check for a NULL pointer here.

2000-11-04  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_init): always create the tooltips
	object.
	(glade_xml_set_toplevel): add a reference to the GtkTooltips
	object for each toplevel window.  We use gtk_object_set_data_full
	so we can remove this reference when the window is destroyed.
	(glade_xml_destroy): unref the tooltips object here.  This will
	not destroy the tooltips, as the GtkWindows now hold a reference.

2000-11-02  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* configure.in (have_bonobo): require Bonobo 0.27

2000-10-08  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.h: remove "#pragma }", which was stuffing up a
	C++ compiler

2000-10-07  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (pbox_page_setup_signals): ditto.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (note_page_setup_signals): make the map and
	unmap signals hold a reference to the accel group.  Get rid of the
	destroy handler which unref'd the accel group.

2000-09-18  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_pop_accel): unref the accel group
	when popping it off the stack.  These things don't have a floating
	reference.

2000-09-03  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_init): Initialize priv->tree to
	NULL, otherwise we will pick up uninitialized memory when unrefing
	a GladeXML that failed to load.

2000-08-13  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* configure.in (have_bonobo): require Bonobo 0.17

	* glade/glade-bonobo.c (gnome_control_new): fix for latest Bonobo.

2000-08-01  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* configure.in: revert Martin's patch.  The GNOME_INIT_HOOK macro
	already handles a --with-gnome switch, and it was preventing the
	configure script from auto detecting gnome.

2000-07-30  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-sax.c: fixed small memory leak in glade_widget_tree_unref
	found by SigWait <sigwait@yahoo.com>.

2000-07-28  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

	* configure.in (--without-gnome): New configure parameter to
	disable GNOME support.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (menushell_build_children): add tearoffs to
	menus if gnome_preferences_get_menus_have_tearoff() is true.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (custom_new): use glade_create_custom.

	* glade/glade-build.h: prototype for glade_create_custom.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_set_custom_handler): implementation.
	Default custom handler use GModule like before.
	(glade_create_custom): function for use in glade-gtk.c

	* glade/glade-xml.h: add prototype for setting a function used to
	create custom widgets.

2000-06-25  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (pixmapmenuitem_new): revert visible accels.
	(pixmapmenuitem_new): fix problem correctly by adding an accel
	label to the GtkPixmapMenuItem and attaching it to the menu item.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (menuitem_new): 
	(checkmenuitem_new): 
	(radiomenuitem_new): revert visible accel patch here.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (toolbar_build_children): same here.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (toolbar_build_children): set group on radio
	buttons in a toolbar.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (href_new): default url to "" rather than
	NULL, so we don't crash if url is not specified in glade file.
	Fixes #9206

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (radiomenuitem_new): applied Mitch Chapman's patch
	to add group support to radiomenuitems.

2000-05-20  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* NEWS: news updates.

	* doc/Makefile.am (scan): change so you don't need an X connection
	during build of documentation.
	(uninstall-local): add uninstall hook to uninstall libglade docs, to
	make distcheck work.
	(distclean-local): yet another rule to make distcheck work.

	* configure.in: incremented package version number.

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): updated libtool version number.

	The reason for the following change is that it makes the
	functionality of the libglade-gnome library different depending on
	where it was built.  A better solution to this is a form of
	dynamic loading, which I am going to look at.

	* glade/glade-bonobo.c: resurect this file.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: remove bonobo code.

	* glade/Makefile.am (libglade_bonobo_la_LIBADD): split bonobo back
	out into a separate library.

2000-05-06   Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: AM_CONDITIONAL needs to be called on the bonobo
	flag, so restore that.  Also add AC_SUBST(BONOBO_SUPPORT_FALSE) to
	make sure it gets substituted in libglade-config, otherwise bad
	things happen.

2000-05-05   Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: actually substitute the BONOBO_SUPPORT_FALSE flag
	required by libglade-config.in. Probably someone forgot to commit
	something.

2000-05-04  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* glade/Makefile.am: update.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (gnome_control_new): move here.
	(glade_gnome_init): update for bonobo case.

	* glade/glade-bonobo.c: from here; kill this file.
	
	* configure.in (have_bonobo): add define for bonobo.

	* acconfig.h: and here.

2000-04-15  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	Notebook patch from Jon K Hellan:
	
	* glade/glade-gtk.c (notebook_build_children): push accelerators for
	each notebook page, so only accels on the visible page are enabled.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (propbox_build_children): push accelerators for
	each notebook page, so only accels on the visible page are enabled.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_{push,pop}_accel): change over to
	these for accelerator handling.

	* glade/glade-build.h: add prototypes for glade_xml_{push,pop}_accel.

	Memory leak fixes from Morten:
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_destroy): free the radio group hash
	table after building the widgets.  Leak also found by Morten.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (combo_new): free combo item list.  Bug reported
	by Morten

2000-04-01  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* glade/glade-bonobo.c (gnome_control_new): update to new Bonobo API.

	* configure.in (have_bonobo): bump required version to 0.10

2000-03-25  Peter Teichman <peter@helixcode.com>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_build_widget): add set_common_params
	logic for bonobo control + clean flow. (glade_xml_set_common_params):
	update for bonobo controls.

2000-03-13  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.h: added prototypes for new functions.

	* libglade.m4 (module_args): add support for bonobo library to macro.

	* libglade-config.in: added support for the bonobo library to this
	script.

	* NEWS: added news items.

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): updated libtool version number.

	* doc/libglade-sections.txt: add extra functions to documentation.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_get_widget_prefix): new function
	for finding all widgets starting with a particular prefix.  This
	is based on the glade_xml_get_widgets function suggested by
	Martijn van Beers.
	(glade_xml_signal_connect_data): new function to connect a named
	signal and allow the user to set the signal data.

2000-03-10  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* configure.in: Check for unistd.h.

	* acconfig.h: Add HAVE_UNISTD_H.

	* glade/glade-sax.c: Guard inclusion of unistd.h.

	* glade/glade-xml.h
	* glade/glade-xml.c: Rename the textdomain field to txtdomain as
	textdomain() is a libintl function, and can in certain cases be
	#defined as textdomain__ by libintl.h. This causes trouble if
	libintl.h is included after glade-xml.h.

	* config.h.win32
	* makefile.mingw
	* glade/makefile.mingw
	* glade/glade.def: New files for Win32 port. As in the GLib, GTk+, 
	and GIMP ports, we use hand-written makefiles and config.h files,
	at least for now.

	* Makefile.am
	* glade/Makefile.am: Add above new files to EXTRA_DIST.

2000-03-10  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* glade/glade-bonobo.c: Add.

	* glade/glade.h: add glade_bonobo_init.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_build_widget): Add extended widget
	support.

	* glade/glade-private.h: Add extended_widget prototype.

	* glade/Makefile.am (THE_FLAGS): add Bonobo support.

	* configure.in: add bonobo checks.

	* autogen.sh (PKG_NAME): change to libGlade.

2000-03-12  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): don't bother with the THE_FLAGS
	stuff.  If gnome support is not enabled, then the GNOME_INCLUDEDIR
	macro will expand to nothing.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (pixmapmenuitem_new): check for a user icon
	as well as stock icons.  This change is based on a patch from
	David Santiago <mrcooger@cyberverse.com>.

2000-03-10  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (gnome_uiinfo_mapping): added an entry for
	GNOMEUIINFO_MENU_NEW_SUBTREE.
	(dock_build_children): use gnome_app_add_dock_item if this dock
	is a child of a GnomeApp.  This doesn't seem to help with getting
	it to use the saved dock layout though :(

	* glade/glade-private.h: removed some prototypes that also apear in
	glade-xml.h.

2000-03-09  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* libglade-xgettext (TranslatableStringParser.add_string): don't
	add the string "" to the catalog.

	* glade/*.c: updated copyright to include 2000.
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_set_common_params): handle the case
	where the events parameter is returned as a string rather than a
	simple integer, as it is in current versions of glade.

2000-03-08  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (progressbar_new): added support for progress
	bar attributes.

2000-01-22  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (paned_build_children): recognise the resize
	and shrink child packing attributes.

1999-12-16  Eric Gillespie Jr.  <epg@pobox.com>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (hpaned_new): Now handles the 'position' attribute.
	(vpaned_new): Same here.

1999-12-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* configure.in: incremented package version to 0.11.

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): incremented libtool version.

	(inputdialog_new): added support for GtkInputDialog.

1999-12-04  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c, glade/glade-gnome.c: other fixes.
	
	* glade/glade-gnome.c (toolbar_build_children): same here.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (toolbar_build_children): do not die if pixmap
	couldn't be found.

	* glade/glade-xml.c: added more assertions.

1999-12-03  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-sax.c: added some assertions to the tree ref/unref
	code.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_destroy): patch to prevent segfaults
	on bad .glade files from Michael Meeks.

1999-11-20  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* README: updated readme file.  It was really out of date.

	* configure.in: incremented package version number.

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): incremented libtool version number.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (pixmap_new): make sure we don't crash when the
	pixmap can't be found.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_set_window_props): fixed bug in
	call to gtk_window_set_policy.

1999-11-16  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): updated libtool version number.

	* NEWS: added news items.

	* configure.in: incremented version number.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (about_new): 
	(gnomedialog_new): 
	(messagebox_new): 
	(app_new): 
	(propbox_new): use glade_xml_set_window_props to set common window
	properties.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (window_new): 
	(dialog_new): 
	(fileselection_new): 
	(colorselectiondialog_new): 
	(fontselectiondialog_new): use glade_xml_set_window_props to set
	common window properties.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_set_window_props): new helper function
	to set properties common to GtkWindow derived widgets.

	* test-libglade.c: added licence to test-libglade example.  It is
	dual licenced under GPL and X style licence, so it should be safe
	for people to use as a base for programs that use libglade but have
	different licencing to libglade.

1999-11-13  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_set_common_params): added patch to
	correctly unset the CAN_FOCUS flag on widgets.  The patch came from
	Andreas Degert <ad@papyrus-gmbh.de>

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (toolbar_new): use the toolbar style as set in
	the control center, rather than that in the XML file.
	(dockitem_new): fixed bug with setting name of dock items.  Patch
	came from Eric Gillepsi Jr. <epg@pobox.com>.

1999-11-12  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (toolbar_build_children): same here.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (toolbar_build_children): check if we are adding
	a toggle button or radio button, and handle those cases correctly.

	* configure.in (libxml check): this is libglade, not gnorpm.  Fixed
	simple cut and paste error from messages in the libxml check.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (pixmapmenuitem_new): make sure labels are
	left justified in GtkPixmapMenuItems.

1999-11-01  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (label_new, accellabel_new): understand the wrap
	property of label widgets.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: understand GNOME_STOCK_PIXMAP_EXIT and
	GNOME_STOCK_MENU_EXIT as well as the QUIT variants.

	* configure.in: make sure a new enough version of libxml is installed
	on the system.  AFAIK, 1.7.2 was the first version to contain the
	required functions.

	* glade/glade-sax.c (glade_widget_tree_parse_file): use the
	xmlSAXUserParseFile function instead of my_xmlSAXParseFile.
	(glade_widget_tree_parse_memory): similar with xmlSAXUserParseMemory.

	Now we don't need to include parserInternals.h, so libglade will be
	less likely to break when libxml internals change.

1999-10-28  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gnome-widgets.glade: added GnomeDruid example to file.
	
	* glade/glade-gnome.c (druidpage_build_children): use
	glade_xml_set_common_params to handle the GnomeDruidPageStandard's
	internal vbox.  This causes border width, etc to be handled
	correctly.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_gettext): always return the empty
	string for empty message ids.  Most catalogs have a translation
	from the empty message id to some info about the catalog.  We don't
	want to display this.

	* glade/glade-sax.c: fixed test to remove placeholders from internal
	representation of the XML file.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (label_new, accellabel_new): fixed mem leak found
	by Morten.  This fixes bug #3127.

1999-09-28  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* NEWS: added news items.

	* configure.in: incremented package version number.

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): incremented libtool version number.

	* gnome-widgets.glade: extended it by adding a proprety box to the
	example.
	
	* glade/glade-gnome.c (gnomedialog_build_children): fix seg fault when
	inserting normal buttons into a GnomeDialog's action area.  This
	fixes bug #2323.

	* glade/glade-tree.c (glade_tree_get): fixed up a seg fault when the
	XML file could not be parsed or does not exist.

1999-09-20  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (stock_button_new): carried Miguel's button
	patch over to the gnome code.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (button_new, togglebutton_new, checkbutton_new):
	(radiobutton_new):  do not translate the strings twice.  It could
	cause weird problems.

	* NEWS: added extra news items.

	* configure.in: incremented package version.

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): incremented libtool library version.

1999-09-19  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_set_common_params): check if the widget
	is the default or focus widget for the window.
	(glade_xml_set_toplevel): call gtk_widget_grab_default or grab_focus
	on the appropriate widgets when we are ready to build the next window.
	(glade_xml_build_interface): set the default/focus widgets for the
	last window to be built as well.
	(glade_xml_init): set default_widget and focus_widget to NULL at
	startup.

	* glade/glade-private.h (GladeXMLPrivate): add members to hold default
	and focus widgets for a window.

1999-09-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* glade/glade-sax.c: Set can_focus to zero initially.  If the
	widget can focus, Glade will explicitly list it.

1999-09-14  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-sax.c (gladeEndElement): extract has_default, has_focus
	into appropriate elements.
	(gladeEndElement): remove placeholders from the interface description.
	To get old behaviour, don't define REMOVE_PLACEHOLDERS at top of 

	* glade/glade-widget-tree.h: added has_default and has_focus flags.

1999-09-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (label_new): Do not translate a string if it
	is empty. 
	(button_new): ditto.
	(checkbutton_new): ditto.
	(menuitem_new): ditto.
	(checkmenuitem_new): ditto.
	(radiomenuitem_new): ditto

1999-09-12  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-sax.c: got rid of an infinite loop in the accelerator
	modifier parsing code.  This fixes bug #2098

1999-09-06  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* NEWS: added news items for stuff I have added for this release.

	* configure.in: incremented package version.

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): incremented libtool version.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (propbox_build_children): added similar
	behaviour here.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (notebook_build_children): added underline
	accelerator support for notebook tabs.  You can switch between
	pages of the notebook by using the underline accelerator on the
	page's tab.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (button_build_children): same function here
	for gnome support.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (button_build_children): new function for
	building button children.  It also adds an accelerator for the
	clicked signal if appropriate.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_set_common_params): check to see if
	any label underline accelerators have to be attached.

	* glade/glade-private.h (GladeXMLPrivate): added new fields for
	label underline accelerators.

	* glade/glade-build.h: added prototypes for the new functions.
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_handle_label_accel): handle label
	underline accelerators.
	(glade_xml_get_parent_accel): routine for getting underline
	accelerators directed at the parent widget.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (label_new): extract the underline accelerator
	from the label.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (propbox_new): set up the property box to use
	a new accel group.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_get_adjustment): accept the adjustment
	element names from glade 0.5.2 and pre 0.5.2.

1999-09-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_new_from_memory): added new function
	to create a GladeXML object from a in memory buffer.

	* po/POTFILES.in: removed all the entries someone added here to
	discourage people from translating this module.  None of the installed
	components need translation.
	
	* glade/glade-sax.c (my_xmlSAXParseMemory):
	* glade/glade-sax.c (glade_widget_tree_parse_memory): added an function
	to create a GladeWidgetTree from a string.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (layout_new): added support for GtkLayout.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (iconlist_new): added support for GnomeIconList.
	(iconsel_new): support for GnomeIconSelection.
	(druid*): added support for GnomeDruid, GnomeDruidPageStart,
	GnomeDruidPageFinish, GnomeDruidPageStandard.
	(pixmap_new): added support for GnomePixmap.
	(propbox_new): added support for GnomePropertyBox.

	* glade/glade-build.h: changed declaration of GladeWidgetBuildData
	structure so it does not cause problems for newer gtk-doc's.

1999-09-04  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* doc/Makefile.am (scan): fixed up target so that libtool works
	correctly even if it does not recognise the C compiler name (there
	were problems with CC=egcs).

	* glade/glade-xml.c: save a reference to the GladeWidgetTree
	structure, and unref it when the GladeXML structure is destroyed.
	This is so it does not get destroyed if it gets purged from the
	cache.

	* glade/glade-private.h: added the GladeWidgetTree to the private
	structure.

	* glade/glade-tree.c (glade_tree_get): check mtime on file to see
	if tree needs to be read in again.

	* glade/glade-sax.c: added implementations of reference counting
	routines, and save modification time of the file in the structure.

	* glade/glade-widget-tree.h: added an mtime field to GladeWidgetTree
	and added reference counting.

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): removed languages from the ALL_LINGUAS
	variable.  Obviously no one read the message above it stating that
	libglade doesn't install anything that needs translation.

	* glade/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): removed last reference to
	glade-keys.c which was breaking the build on some systems.

1999-09-01  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* po/da.po: added danish file

1999-08-24  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* test-libglade.c (main): when building only part of the widget tree,
	if the toplevel is not a GtkWindow descendant, pack it inside a
	container window.  For example, "./test-libglade gnome-widgets.glade
	menubar1" will show just the menu bar in a window.

	* NEWS: updated news file.

	* configure.in: incremented package version number.

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): incremented libtool version number.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (packer_new, packer_build_children): added
	support for the GtkPacker widget.

	* glade/Makefile.am: removed references to glade-keys.c.  It is no
	longer needed.

	* glade/glade-private.h (glade_key_get): removed prototype.

	* glade/glade-sax.c (gladeEndElement): switched over to using
	gdk_keyval_from_name rather than using glade_key_get.  This saves
	a bit of memory.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (radiobutton_new): fixed radio button group
	handling.
	(table_new): fixed up recognition of the column_spacing attribute.

1999-08-09  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* Makefile.am: removed dist-hook for the generated libglade.spec.
	This is handled by automake when you add it to EXTRA_DIST.

	* libglade.spec.in (Requires): specifically require libxml >= 1.3.
	Older versions have an incompatible SAX interface.

	* glade/Makefile.am (LTVERSION): incrementented libtool version number.

	* configure.in: incremented version number to 0.3

1999-08-07  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_new): fixed a small memory leak when
	the interface could not be constructed correctly.  This bug was found
	by Morten.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: added support for GtkEntry child widgets on the
	Gnome*Entry widgets.  Added support for GnomeCanvas, GnomeIconEntry,
	GnomeNumberEntry.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (combo_build_children): setup signals on the
	GtkEntry.

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, glade/Makefile.am: removed the
	LIBGLADE_FULLDIST conditional, since it is no longer being used.
	This also cleans up the makefiles a bit.

1999-08-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (stock_button_new): uline accelerator support
	here as well.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: added uline accelerator support for buttons,
	check buttons, toggle buttons and radio buttons.

1999-08-04  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* doc/libglade-sections.txt: added new functions to documentation
	list.

	* gnome-widgets.glade: updated xml of the message box widget.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (messagebox_new): the `type' attribute has been
	renamed `message_box_type'.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c, glade/glade-gnome.c: added calls to
	glade_xml_set_toplevel to the routines for all the toplevel window
	widget types.  Added code to parse uline accelerators for menu items.

	* glade/glade-build.h: added prototypes for the new functions.
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_push_uline_accel,
	glade_xml_pop_uline_accel, glade_xml_get_uline_accel): helper
	functions for setting up uline accelerators.
	(glade_xml_set_toplevel): new function.
	(glade_xml_ensure_accel): new function to get current (non uline)
	accel group.

	* glade/glade-private.h (GladeXMLPrivate): added some extra fields
	to the structure to hold information about the current accel group.

1999-08-02  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* doc/Makefile.am (scan): yet another fix.  Now it runs gtkdoc-scanobj
	in the build directory rather than srcdir.  This one actually works
	correctly with builddir != srcdir and libglade not installed when I
	do a distcheck.
	
	* doc/Makefile.am (scan): set CC to "$(LIBTOOL) $(CC)" for
	gtkdoc-scanobj, and make it link the test program with the libtool
	libraries rather than the installed libraries.

	* Makefile.am: changed to build the glade subdir before doc.
	Include libglade.spec in tarballs (it was probably removed when
	libglade.spec.in was added).

1999-07-30  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* test-libglade.c (main): give an error if glade_xml_new returns an
	error.

	* glade/glade-sax.c: make the parser more graceful for bad documents.

1999-07-29  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* doc/tmpl/glade-sax.sgml: added a small description of these
	functions.

	* doc/libglade-sections.txt: added documentation section on the SAX
	parser.

	* glade/glade-sax.c: added API doc comments.

	* glade/glade-xml.c: updated the inline documentation to reflect
	that xmlNode structures are no longer used.
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c, glade/glade-gtk.c, glade/glade-gnome.c: removed
	some unused variables.

	* glade/glade-styles.c: removed file.  Most of its functionality was
	moved to the glade-sax parser, so there was not much reason for
	keeping glade_style_attach in a single file.
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_style_attach): moved this function in
	from glade-styles.c.

	* configure.in: added a check to make sure you are using a new
	enough libxml.  This is required because the SAX API underwent a
	number of changes, so old versions of libxml are not good enough.

	* Makefile.am (THE_FLAGS, THE_LIBS): these variables had the wrong
	values when gnome support was disabled.

	* glade/*.c, glade/*.h: updated copyright messages to include 1999.

1999-07-28  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-sax.c: the parser was saving the border_width attribute
	to width, which caused a few problems.
	(gladeEndDocument): removed a debugging message.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (*_new): converted the rest of this library.
	
	* glade/glade-gnome.c (*_build_children): converted over all the
	child building routines.  Now I just need to do all the *_new
	functions.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (*): converted over to using glade-sax parser.
	Now libglade.la builds again.  Whether it works or not is another
	matter :)

1999-07-27  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/Makefile.am (the_sources): added glade-sax.c.
	(the_headers): added glade-widget-tree.h.

	* glade/glade-xml.c: updated to use the glade-sax parser.  It no
	longer includes the libxml headers.

1999-07-26  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-styles.c (glade_style_parse): stripped out all the
	style parsing code -- this is handled by glade-sax now.

	* glade/glade-tree.c: converted to cache the output of the glade-sax
	parser instead of the libxml one.

	* glade/glade-widget-info.h: the structures that the new SAX parser.
	This is the public interface to the parser.

	* glade/glade-sax.c: the new SAX based parser for libglade.

1999-07-09  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_gettext): return "" for a NULL msgid.
	This fixes segfaults in some situations (eg. a label with no text in
	it).  This bug was found by Jon Travis <jtravis@cse.unl.edu>.

1999-06-20  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* dialogs.glade: example of using the standard dialogs with libglade.
	
	* configure.in: upped version number to 0.2.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: small clean up.

	* doc/libglade-docs.sgml: a few more changes to the documentation.

1999-06-19  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (gnomedialog_build_children): connect signals
	to the individual button widgets.
	(messagebox_build_children): similar for the message box widget.

	* doc/libglade-docs.sgml: heaps of extra docs.  This should reduce
	the number of libglade questions people ask me (assuming they
	read the docs of course :).

	* doc/libglade-sections.txt: added entries for the extra functions.

	* glade/glade-xml.h, glade/glade-xml.c
	(glade_xml_signal_connect_full, glade_xml_signal_autoconnect_full):
	Added two functions that should be useful for people wanting to write
	language bindings for libglade.  They allow the user to specify an
	arbitrary function to use for connecting signals.

1999-06-17  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gnome-widgets.glade: made the test glade file for GNOME a bit
	nicer.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (toolbar_new): make toolbar button relief
	match user preferences.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (text_new): small bug fix to text widget creation.

1999-06-14  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade.h: moved the include of glade/glade-xml.h outside of
	the extern "C" { ... } block, since it has its own extern "C" { ... }
	stuff (and the extern "C" notation is not valid in C).

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (optionmenu_new, combo_new): made adjustments to
	match change in libglade-xgettext.

	* libglade-xgettext (TranslatableStringParser.end_items): add list
	items to translation list individually instead of as one large string.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (gnomedialog_new, app_new): added support for
	setting wmname/wmclass on these windows as well.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: added support for GtkFileSelection,
	GtkColorSelectionDialog and GtkFontSelectionDialog, including
	the support for connecting signals to their buttons.
	Also added support for setting the wmname/wmclass on windows.

1999-06-13  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: put #ifdef's round references to
	GNOME_STOCK_PIXMAP_MIDI, so it will compile with gnome-libs-1.0.1
	(Damon is keeping compatibility with that release for glade, so
	I may as well do so as well).

1999-06-13  Richard Hestilow  <hestgray@ionet.net>

	* glade/glade-xml.h, glade-build.h, glade.h: added 
	"#ifdef __cplusplus" wrappers, otherwise was giving linktime
	errors with g++.
	
1999-06-12  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.c: fixed up gettext call.

	* configure.in: added a call to AM_GNOME_GETTEXT so that the i18n
	stuff should get included correctly.  Note that there is no libglade
	translation domain -- libglade should not give any of its own output.

1999-06-11  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-xml.[ch] (glade_xml_construct): added a third argument -
	the translation domain.
	(glade_xml_new_with_domain): a new constructor that allows you to
	specify that this GladeXML object use a different translation
	domain than the default.
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_set_common_params): translate the
	tooltips.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: added calls to glade_xml_gettext at appropriate
	places.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: added calls to glade_xml_gettext at appropriate
	places.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_gettext): new function to handle
	translations of text in widget building routines.

	* glade/glade-xml.h: added textdomain attribute to GladeXML structure
	that will hold the gettext text domain used for translations.  This
	is just in preparation -- I haven't added i18n to libglade yet.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_relative_file): small fix in call
	to g_strconcat().  This one was picked up by Gary Ross.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (get_stock_name): now reads GNOME_STOCK_PIXMAP_
	and GNOME_STOCK_MENU_ style stock names correctly.
	(toolbar_new, toolbar_build_children): functions for building toolbars
	that is aware of stock icons.  Now the toolbars look correct.
	(menu_new, menubar_new, menushell_build_children): Handle stock
	menu items correctly.  It even handles gnome-libs' internal
	translation of stock menu item labels.
	(pixmapmenuitem_new): This function does not worry about stock menu
	items now.  It does handle pixmaps next to the menu items though
	like it should.

	* Makefile.am (bin_SCRIPTS): added libglade-xgettext.

	* libglade-xgettext: a small program that can extract translation
	strings from glade XML files.  Libglade itself has no i18n support
	yet, but this is a start.  The program can output both standard pot
	files or a C file that can then be parsed by xgettext.

1999-06-10  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* test-libglade.c (main): updated to call glade_gnome_init() instead
	of glade_init() if GNOME support is enabled.

	* libglade.m4 (module_args): modified macro so that you can pass
	`gnome' as the third argument to get GNOME support.

	* libglade-config.in: you can now pass it the arguments gtk and gnome
	to indicate which widget sets you wish to use.  If you specify
	GNOME, the --libs output will include -lglade-gnome.

	* glade/Makefile.am: create a separate libglade-gnome library if
	GNOME support is enabled.
	
	* glade/glade-gnome.c: implemented the GnomeApp, GnomeAppBar,
	GnomeDock, GnomeDockItem and GtkPixmapItem (sort of).  Just about
	everything displays, except that the GNOMEUIINFO stuff, which is
	not properly implemented at this point in time.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c (about_new): make the about dialog creation
	routine use the values of gnome_app_id and gnome_app_version.

	* glade/glade-tree.c (recurse_tree, destroy_func): the hash table of
	widget name -> xmlNode was broken.  It was freeing the keys before
	they were used.  This bug is from when I was converting libglade
	over to using xmlNodeGetContent().  It should now be possible to
	use the glade_xml_new("filename", "rootnode") style of initialisation,
	and signal handlers that should be connected with
	gtk_signal_connect_object should now work correctly as well.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (pixmap_new): the filename of the pixmap should
	be relative to the xml file.
	(toolbar_new, toolbar_build_children): fixed up toolbar support.  I
	used code from the examples by Craig M. Buchek and Gary Ross.  The
	actual implementation is different than both, but the sample code
	was very helpful.

	* doc/libglade-sections.txt: added extra entries to documentation.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_set_common_params): new function that
	exposes some of the work that glade_xml_build_widget performs.

	* glade/glade-xml.h, glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_relative_file):
	new function that resolves a filename that is relative to the XML
	file for an interface.  This is useful for resolving image file
	names and other external files.
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_build_widget): make the height and
	width setting code work correctly (before, setting width would unset
	the height and vice versa).

1999-06-09  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added the custom.glade and
	gnome-widgets.glade examples to the distribution.

	* glade/glade-xml.h, glade/glade-xml.c: changed the second argument
	name in glade_xml_signal_connect to handlername, so that people who
	don't want to read the docs do not get confused as easily :)

1999-06-09  Michael Meeks  <michael@edenproject.org>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_new): Added return NULL on error
	(glade_xml_construct): Added boolean - success return value.

1999-06-08  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* Makefile.am (confexec_DATA): install the libgladeConf.sh script.

	* libgladeConf.sh.in: A file for use with the gnome-config shell
	script.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: added support for GnomeDialog and
	GnomeMessageBox.  This still leaves support for GnomeApp to be done.
	Before this can be finished though, I need to work out the stock
	menu (GnomeUIInfo) stuff.  I don't know how difficult this will be.

1999-06-06  Erik Walthinsen  <omega@cse.ogi.edu>

	* converted libglade.spec to libglade.spec.in, made appropiate
	changes in .cvsignore, Makefile.am, and configure.in.

	* added libglade.m4 to the spec file

1999-06-07  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* custom.glade: an example of using custom widgets.  In this example,
	it creates a color selection widget, but the code could be used for
	creating any widget.  The custom widget code also requires that
	gmodule functions correctly on the system.
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c, glade/glade-gtk.c: don't close the module
	opened by g_module_open(NULL, 0).  Reference counting does not
	apear to be done on this GModule structure.

1999-06-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_destroy): Ok, another fix to my
	previous fix: there was no actual memory leak.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (radiobutton_new): Small bug fix to my
	previous change: Glade might output radio buttons without groups. 

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_destroy): Memory leak fix: free all
	the keys (they were strduped strings) when destroying hash tables.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (radiobutton_new): Add support for
	radio-button-groups. 

	* glade/glade-private.h: Add new hash-table for radio-button
	groups. 

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_init): Allocate private structure.
	(glade_xml_destroy): free private structure.
	(glade_xml_build_widget): Use data from private structure.
	(glade_xml_construct): ditto.
	(autoconnect_foreach): ditto.
	(glade_xml_signal_autoconnect): ditto.
	(glade_xml_get_widget): ditto.
	(glade_xml_get_widget_by_long_name): ditto.
	(glade_xml_build_widget): ditto.
	(glade_xml_signal_connect): ditto
	(glade_xml_add_signal): ditto.
	(glade_xml_build_widget): De-ambiguate else clause here.

	* glade/glade-private.h: Moved private GladeXML members to the
	GladeXMLPrivate structure.

1999-06-04  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (optionmenu_new): Only add items if there are
	any actual items.
	(combo_new): ditto.

1999-06-03  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* Makefile.am (m4data_DATA): install the libglade.m4 macro.

	* libglade.m4: added an autoconf macro to detect libglade.

1999-06-06  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: added support for the Custom widget (the widget
	is created with a user defined function).  This should make it easier
	to produce a complete UI from a program, using custom widgets for the
	complicated parts of the UI.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: added build routines for a few of the
	widgets that are in the current CVS version of GLADE.  I haven't
	done wrappers for GnomeApp, GnomeDialog, GnomeMessageBox and GLADE's
	GnomeUIInfo stuff.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: removed all the GNOME specific code from this
	file.  Now all GNOME specific stuff is inside glade-gnome.c (except
	for the initialiser in glade-init.c).

	* glade/Makefile.am: add glade-gnome.c to the library if GNOME
	support is enabled.

	* glade/glade-init.c (glade_init): initialise the gnome widgets if
	gnome support has been built in.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: new file that holds all the GNOME specific
	widget routines.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: removed container_build_children function, and
	changed all references to it to glade_standard_build_children.

	* glade/glade-build.h: added prototype for the function.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_standard_build_children): added the
	standard child building routine here, as it will be useful to
	both gtk and gnome code.
	(glade_get_adjustment): similar to above.

1999-06-06  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: added support for the Custom widget (the widget
	is created with a user defined function).  This should make it easier
	to produce a complete UI from a program, using custom widgets for the
	complicated parts of the UI.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: added build routines for a few of the
	widgets that are in the current CVS version of GLADE.  I haven't
	done wrappers for GnomeApp, GnomeDialog, GnomeMessageBox and GLADE's
	GnomeUIInfo stuff.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: removed all the GNOME specific code from this
	file.  Now all GNOME specific stuff is inside glade-gnome.c (except
	for the initialiser in glade-init.c).

	* glade/Makefile.am: add glade-gnome.c to the library if GNOME
	support is enabled.

	* glade/glade-init.c (glade_init): initialise the gnome widgets if
	gnome support has been built in.

	* glade/glade-gnome.c: new file that holds all the GNOME specific
	widget routines.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: removed container_build_children function, and
	changed all references to it to glade_standard_build_children.

	* glade/glade-build.h: added prototype for the function.

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_standard_build_children): added the
	standard child building routine here, as it will be useful to
	both gtk and gnome code.
	(glade_get_adjustment): similar to above.

1999-06-04  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (optionmenu_new): Only add items if there are
	any actual items.
	(combo_new): ditto.

1999-06-03  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* Makefile.am (m4data_DATA): install the libglade.m4 macro.

	* libglade.m4: added an autoconf macro to detect libglade.

1999-05-27  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* libglade-config.in (libs): add gnome libraries to the link line.
	(the gnome macros evaluate to nothing if gnome is not found).

	* test-libglade.c: small fix so that it will build without gnome.

	* NEWS: updated news.

	* libglade.spec: same here.  Also include documentation in devel
	tarball.

	* configure.in: bumped version number up to 0.1.

1999-05-23  Jacob Berkman  <jberk+@cmu.edu>

	* doc/Makefile.am: added an if GNOME_SUPPORT
	PROBLEM: make dies in doc if libglade has not been installed
	yet.  I tried tinkering a bit but couldn't make it work

1999-05-16  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* glade/Makefile.am (glade-keys.c): Mention explicitly that
	glade-keys.c is built in $(srcdir).
	* glade/glade-gtk.c (button_stock_new): Declare type for `len'.

1999-05-11  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* doc/*: use gtkdoc to generate documentation for libglade.
	
	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_build_widget): cleaned up some of
	Damon's changes -- I had already added support for the new lowercase
	signal and accelerator tags.  Also added some missing documentation.

	* glade/glade-xml.h, glade/glade-build.h: a few small changes so that
	the documentation builds correctly.
	
	* libglade-config.in: a few small changes to this script.  Include
	the libxml cflags in the output of --cflags.

1999-04-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* glade/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): for included-compilation of
	libglade, include the header files manually.

1999-04-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* glade/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Include -I$(srcdir)/.. to get our
	headers to have more precedence over installed headers for an
	existing libglade installation.

1999-04-25  bertrand <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@inria.fr>

	* glade/glade-init.c (glade_load_module): typo fix.

1999-04-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* glade/glade-styles.c (glade_style_attach): Use g_strconcat
	instead of a static buffer;
	(fill_style): Use g_strdup_printf instead of static buffer.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c (label_new): Add missing call to free (content).


	* glade/glade-gtk.c: Use <glade/glade-build.h> to fetch headers. 
	* glade/glade-styles.c: ditto. 
	* glade/glade-private.h: ditto.

1999-04-25  Damon Chaplin  <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk>

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_build_widget): The 'Signal' and
	'Accelerator' tags were changed to lower case in Glade, to be
	consistent with	all other widget tags, so I added support for that.

1999-04-24  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): fixed up yet anothe mistake in the
	makefiles.  This should allow libglade to build correctly whether
	it is included as part of a larger package or not.

	* Makefile.am: removed reference to the macros	directory, as they
	break the gnumeric build.  The problem with this is that a
	distributed libglade package would not contain all the files
	needed to build the configure script if you modify the Makefile.am's.

1999-04-24  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* libglade-config.in: don't output -I/usr/include if that is where
	the headers are, as this location is already in the search path.

	* configure.in: removed some unused substitutions.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added macros subdirectory.

	* configure.in: set the automake conditional LIBGLADE_FULLDIST to
	true.  When libglade is built as part of the gnumeric build, this
	configure script is not used, so the makefiles use the value of
	LIBGLADE_FULLDIST from the toplevel gnumeric makefile.  Also added
	a call to AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDE to find the correct macros.

	* glade/glade-init.c, glade/glade-xml.c: added gnome-libs style
	documentation comments to these files, so libglade API docs can be
	generated easily.

1999-04-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: Fix.  If we encounter a placeholder, the code
	was dereferencing a null pointer.  

	(misc_set): pad is an integer, align is a float.

1999-04-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* test-libglade.c (main): Add GNOME support.  Use
	gnome_init_with_popt_table here.  Use argument parsing the popt
	way. 

	* Makefile.am, glade/Makefile.am: Setup for dual GTK+/GNOME
	compilation. 
	
	* glade/glade-gtk.c (button_stock_new): Add support for GNOME
	stock labels.

	* configure.in (have_gnome): Add autodetection for GNOME
	components. 

1999-04-22  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* test-libglade.c (main): argument parsing code wasn't recognising
	the rootnode argument.  This batch of fixes was sent in by Philippe
	Giacinti (I am still reviewing the local style part of the patch).

	* glade/glade-xml.c (glade_xml_get_type): wasn't saving the object
	type correctly.  Caused problems if more than one GladeXML object
	was created.
	(glade_xml_build_widget): in newer versions of GLADE, it uses the
	signal tag instead of Signal, and accelerator instead of Accelerator.
	Now libglade recognises the new tags as having the same meaning.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: some small changes for the box and dialog child
	adding routines (I had GTK_PACK_START where it should have been
	"GTK_PACK_START").

1999-04-20  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* configure.in: bumped required version of GTK up to 1.2.0.

	* glade/glade-xml.c, glade/glade-private.h: changed some occurences
	of "char *" to "const char *" to remove warnings made by Miguel's
	change.

1999-04-20  Erik Walthinsen  <omega@cse.ogi.edu>

	* added libglade-config.in, changed Makefile.am and configure.in
	to match and create libglade-config, added to spec file.

1999-04-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* glade/glade-xml.h: Tag return values as "const char *" to warn
	the user not to free the results of these.

1999-04-06  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: a few small fixes to make libglade compile
	correctly with newer versions of GTK.

1999-01-13  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* autogen.sh: it wasn't calling autoheader, which caused some trouble.

	* glade/glade-gtk.c: some small changes to make it compile with newer
	versions of gtk.  Also made the function call changes found in
	gtkcompat.h

	* glade/glade-xml.c: gtk_container_border_width -> set_border_width.

1998-11-17  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-styles.c: changed to recognise new style tags.  Basically
	occurences of "fg:" have been changed to "fg-", and similar for other
	parts of the style code.

1998-11-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* autogen.sh: added a simple autogen shell script to help with CVS
	builds.

1998-11-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* everything: added copyright messages to the code.

1998-11-02  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/Makefile.am, configure.in: I forgot to include the makekeys.awk
	file in the distribution.  This may have caused problems for some
	people.

1998-11-01  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* configure.in: added option --enable-debug.  This will turn on
	debugging output, which is what has been the default in the previous
	version.  Without this flag, the library is quiet, except for errors.
	* glade/glade-xml.c, glade/makekeys.awk: added support for keyboard
	accelerators.  Makekeys.awk creates glade-keys.c, which handles
	keysym to int conversion.  If no accelerators are used in the UI
	description, this adds no overhead.  If there are accelerators, there
	will be a hash table initialisation, and a hash table lookup for each
	accelerator.

1998-10-31  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-xml.c, glade/glade-gtk.c: made changes so that libglade
	works correctly with the changes Daniel made to libxml.  Note that
	since xmlNodeGetContent doesn't use g_malloc, free is used instead
	of g_free.
	Also, no strings inside the xmlDoc structure are referenced in the
	GladeXML widget, so it should be possible to free the xmlDoc
	structure without problems.

1998-10-25  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-gtk.c: updated for glade-0.3.5 widgets.  It now supports
	menus.  I also fixed up the dialog child packing function.
	* test.glade, simple.glade, example.glade: added some examples.
	* glade/glade-init.c: added interface to extend libglade's list of
	widgets dynamically.  Maybe this could be used so that interfaces
	are listed in the XML, and loaded on call.
	* libglade.spec: a spec file for this package.

1998-10-23  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-gtk.c: new file -- this holds all the widget specific
	code for all the widgets in glade-0.3.3.
	* test-libglade.c: new file -- a tester program that can load
	arbitrary interface files.  I can actually get most interfaces to
	load without problem now.
	* glade/glade-xml.c: added support for automatic connection of signals
	with gmodule (you can get access to the global namespace with
	g_module_open(NULL, 0)).

1998-10-20  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>
	* glade/glade-init.c: new file -- initialisation of libglade.
	* glade/glade-tree.c: new file -- handles reading in and caching of
	XML descriptions.  It also extracts the widget tree, and gets the
	styles parsed.
	* glade/glade-styles.c: new file -- Parses styles from an XML tree
	by translating them to the same format as gtkrc files and passing
	them to gtk_rc_parse_string.
	* glade/glade-xml.c: new file -- This file is the exposed interface
	to libglade, and has code used to glue in widget sets to libglade.
