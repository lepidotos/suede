This is the main Documentation Content List handling utility of Scrollkeeper.

Usage:

Install a document:

	scrollkeeper_cl -i foo.sgml foo.xml

Uninstall a document:

	scrollkeeper_cl -u foo.sgml foo.xml

foo.sgml is the document itself.
foo.xml is the document metadata file.

The output is an xml file representing a documentation tree and containing the new document entry in all the positions in the tree specified by the metadata file. This file is in $(prefix)/var/lib/scrollkeeper/locale_dir.
