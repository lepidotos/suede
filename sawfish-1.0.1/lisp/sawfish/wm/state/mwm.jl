;; Commentary:

;; There's a conflict between the way that sawmill allows frame-styles
;; to be defined, and the way that the window hints (gnome, mwm, ol,
;; ...) ask for particular decorations.

;; One solution might be to add a `class' attibute to each frame part.
;; These would be things like title, border, close, etc... Then if the
;; window has asked for that decor include it, otherwise don't.

;; But this doesn't work because we may be left with holes in the
;; window frame. For example, leaving the close button out of a
;; brushed-metal frame will just take a chunk out of the window corner.

;; For the moment I'll just have to mash the window hints into the four
;; available window types: default, shaped, transient, shaped-transient
