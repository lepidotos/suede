;; Commentary:

;; The protocol is something like:

;;	1. Send a ClientMessage event to the window identified by the
;;	property _SAWFISH_REQUEST_WIN on the root window, event mask 0,
;;	with the event's window field set to the root window, type
;;	_SAWFISH_REQUEST, format 32. data.l[0] = protocol version (1),
;;	data.l[1] = window to use for properties, data.l[2] = property
;;	containing form to evaluate, data.l[3] is non-zero if a result
;;	it required.

;;	2. The wm reads and evaluates the form from the specified
;;	property on the specified window.

;;	3. If a result is required it overwrites the form with its
;;	value, and assumes that the client will delete the property
;;	after it has read it. If no result is required, it will delete
;;	the property after having read it.

;; The result is a string, it's first byte defines whether an error
;; occurred or not, \001 if okay, \002 if an error
