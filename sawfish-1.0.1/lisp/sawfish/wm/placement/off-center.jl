;; Commentary:

;; This placement mode tries to put windows in the center of the
;; screen, but in such a way that the newly placed window doesn't fully
;; obscure an existing window.

;; This is to handle the case where two windows of the same size are
;; created one after the other, so that the user is sure to see (at
;; least part of) both windows
