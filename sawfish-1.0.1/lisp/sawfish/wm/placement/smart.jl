;; Commentary:

;; This implements two different algorithms: first-fit and best-fit. 

;; Both use the same inner core -- they scan for the position to place
;; the window where it overlaps the smallest area with other windows

;; The two algorithms differ where more than one position has this
;; smallest overlap area. The first-fit algorithm takes the first such
;; position found, while the best-fit algorithm tries to choose the
;; best such position.

;; The cost function used for the best-fit currently tries to combine
;; two factors: the future ``usefulness'' of the chosen space, and the
;; number (and size) of the window edges the window will abut when
;; placed in the position
