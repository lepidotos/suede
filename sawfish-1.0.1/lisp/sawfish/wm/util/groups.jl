;; Commentary:

;; Each window may only be a member of a single group, each group is
;; defined by its group id, either an integer or a symbol. Positive
;; integers are used for application-defined groups (window ids, as
;; returned by window-group-id), negative integers are used for
;; user-defined anonymous groups, symbols are used for user-defined
;; named groups.

;; To put a window in a different group to which its application
;; originally put it, set its `group' property (preferably by calling
;; the add-window-to-group function)

;; Only named groups are saved when saving sessions (anything else may
;; not work properly when the windows are reopened, and therefore their
;; ids change)

;; See groups.jl for the commands that manipulate groups of windows
