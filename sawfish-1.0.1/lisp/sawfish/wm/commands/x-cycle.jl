;; Commentary:

;; Cycles through windows in MRU order. Whichever key is used to invoke
;; `cycle-windows' will continue to the next window on the stack when
;; pressed again. Releasing the initial modifier ends the cycling and
;; selects the current window

;; Thanks to Kuba Winnicki <blackwine@optimus.wroc.pl> for the idea:

;; [ assumes command invoked by MOD-KEY, i.e. M-TAB by default ]

;; MOD held;

;; * window 1            window 1            window 1          * window 3
;;   window 2    ==>   * window 2    ==>     window 2    ==>     window 1
;;   window 3    KEY     window 3    KEY   * window 3  release   window 2
;;   window 4            window 4            window 4    MOD     window 4

;; If cycle-raise-windows is enabled, focused window is brought to
;; front, but gets back to original placement in order when it's
;; defocused.

;; Also it'd be nice to be able to cycle through hidden windows as
;; well, like here:

;; MOD held;

;; * window 1            window 1            window 1          * window 3
;;  [window 2]   ==>   * window 2    ==>    [window 2]   ==>     window 1
;;  [window 3]   KEY    [window 3]   KEY   * window 3  release  [window 2]
;;   window 4            window 4            window 4    MOD     window 4

;; Each window may have an x-cycle-order property, an integer id
;; defining its position in the window stack, higher numbers equal
;; more recently selected. The ids may not be contiguous

;; Obviously there would be a problem when we overflow rep's integers, but
;; every now and then we compress the stack to make the ids contiguous

;; It might seem as though it should be possible to use the actual
;; window stacking to define MRU order. But since there are multiple
;; layers of windows this wouldn't work (selected windows may not reach
;; the top of the stack)
