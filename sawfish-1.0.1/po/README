Notes about strings
===================

Sawfish uses some embedded control codes in strings (mostly in the
configurator labels):

`\\w'

Marks where the widget will be inserted into the string. Often used
with entry box and popup menu widgets to put the selected phrase in the
middle of the label. If no `\\w' token exists the label is put before
the widget.

`\n\n'

A double newline separates a widget's label from its (optional)
tooltip. Be sure to preserve both newline characters!

In po files this is usually formatted like:

	msgid ""
	"Label.\n"
	"\n"
	"Tooltip."
	msgstr ""


Notes about gettext version
===========================

Sawfish uses gettext 0.10.35. So please use this version of gettext
and not any later versions to check po files, since some po files may
not be compatible between older and newer gettext.
