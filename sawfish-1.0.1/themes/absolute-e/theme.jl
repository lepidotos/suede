;; from the ABOUT file:

;;    Thanks for using Absolute E, the theme that thinks diffrently.
;;    This theme is created by Hallvar Helleseth using nothing but The
;;    Gimp.  Everything is originaly made by me - Propably the only
;;    Etheme that can say that ;) Though alot of people have helped me
;;    (too many to list here/can't remeber all of them either...) But I
;;    give them a BIG thank you!

;;    There is a GTK and WMaker version of this theme available at
;;    themes.org

;;    This theme is going to be following the cvs version of E and not
;;    the stable version (DR0.15.5)

;;    Reach me at hallvar@ii.uib.no (www.ii.uib.no/~hallvar)
