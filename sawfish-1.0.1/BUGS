BUGS
****

Please report bugs to the mailing list <sawfish@lists.eazel.com>.

When reporting bugs try to include as much relevant information as
possible:

 - Most importantly: a reliable method for triggering the bug. (Once
   the bug can be reproduced it's often straightforward to fix.)

 - If you hear beeping sounds while the problem manifests itself it may
   mean that sawfish's Lisp interpreter is printing error messages to
   the standard error stream (often stored in ~/.xsession-errors or
   ~/.gnomerc-errors). Include any such messages in your bug report.

 - If sawfish crashes it will try to print information describing the
   position at which it did so, look for any `backtrace' messages in
   the error output and include them

 - The operating system type and version (including distribution details)

 - How you installed sawfish, e.g. compiled from source, from binary
   packages, etc.. If from packages, where did you get the packages
   from, and what are their version numbers?

 - Any other information you feel may be relevant. E.g. the values of
   customization options that you feel may affect the problem


See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?product=sawfish for the
sawfish bug database.

Please don't add bugs to this database unless you _are sure_ that they
really are bugs (and when doing so, try to avoid filing duplicates of
existing bug reports, instead expand on existing reports).

If in any doubt (e.g. perhaps the `bug' is really a configuration
issue), don't immediately file a report in bugzilla -- send mail to the
mailing list first.
