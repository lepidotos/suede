HACKING
*******

Please send all patches to the sawfish mailing list <sawfish@lists.eazel.com>.

The only exception to this rule is for .po and .desktop files --
language translators are free to commit any changes to the translations
they maintain.

When possible, please make patches in unified diff format (i.e. `diff -u').
