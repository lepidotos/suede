2000-07-01  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* desktop-entries/meta-properties.desktop: new file, for the

	* Makefile.in: install .order

	* desktop-entries/.directory: use the usual GNOME wm icon

2000-06-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_ok, sawmill_cancel): remove the

	slave process (prevents GDK choking on X errors..?)

	$(GNOMEDIR) which is found by configure

	saw logo for the .directory file)

2000-04-25  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	appropriate

2000-04-24  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* dekstop-entries/sound-properties.desktop: new file

2000-04-12  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-capplet.c (ui_output_callback): code `g' means that
	sawmill-ui couldn't find the group we asked for

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_setup): don't link stderr to the
	parent process, causes problems with GTK errors

2000-03-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-capplet.c: don't assume atomic I/O (pointed out by
	James Antill <james@and.org>)

2000-02-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: install desktop entries under Settings/Sawmill
	in the apps menu as well as in the control center directory

1999-10-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	descriptors before exec'ing

1999-09-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_running_p): use libclient.o to
	check if the wm is running (due to the multiple connection
	methods)

1999-09-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_running_p): new function, test if
	sawmill is actually running
	(sawmill_setup): if the wm isn't running, just print a message
	to this effect in the capplet widget

	* sawmill-capplet.c (main): disabled some of the session
	management stuff that was copied from mouse-properties.c; I
	don't understand it fully and it makes the
	GNOME_SAWMILL_PROPERTIES root property expand forever..

	* sawmill-capplet.c (sawmill_cancel): don't destroy the capplet
	widget
