void Hello_hello(CORBA_Object anobj, const char *arg1, CORBA_Environment *ev)

If we're doing a local call (i.e. shared library object activation),
just do it.

If we're doing a remote call, we need to setup generic header
(utilfunc), setup request header (utilfunc), encode arguments (stubs),
send the message headers & body (utilfunc) and wait for a reply (XXX
define more clearly).  When we get the reply, we need to read the
reply(utilfunc), decode the return value & out/inout arguments(stubs)
& fill them in (or decode the exception that resulted (utilfunc)), and 
return.
