Here you can see the first steps implementing a full CORBA-compliant 
CosEvent-service.

Just now, nearly nothing is working.

To use the event server, you have to start it like this

orbit-event-server >/tmp/event-service-ior

There is a new interface in the CosEventChannelAdmin module, that is:

module CosEventChannelAdmin {
	interface EventChannelFactory {
		EventChannel new_event_channel();	
	};
};

Thats the way to obtain new channels. The ior, that orbit-event-server
outputs is the object-reference of this Factory.

Then you can test the event server with the event-consumer and
event-supplier progs, which are not ready yet.

The whole thing is also some kind of test environment for the new
ORBit any implementation.

TODO:

- is there a better way to get a new channel. the spec is not very
  verbose about it.
