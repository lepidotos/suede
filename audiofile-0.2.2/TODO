Audio File Library 0.2.2
Michael Pruett <mpruett@sgi.com>

Short-term
----------

Sample rate conversion needs to be handled.

Handle more compressed data formats, most importantly ADPCM and Ogg
Vorbis.  GSM 06.10 would also be nice.

More comprehensive tests should be developed to stress-test the
library.  Tests are needed most for the following sets of functions:
	* af{Get,Set}VirtualChannels/afSetChannelMatrix
	* afGetSampleFormat/af{Get,Set}VirtualSampleFormat
	* af{Get,Set}Loop{IDs,Mode,Count,Start,End,StartFrame,EndFrame,Track}

Support for auxiliary data in IRCAM files (maximum amplitude, comments,
etc.) should be added.

Long-term
---------

Support for reading and writing to pipes for IRCAM, NeXT, and raw data
file formats should be investigated.  (The AIFF and WAVE file formats
are more structured and couldn't cope with not being able to seek.)
It's my suspicion that the work involved in this will be substantial.

It would be nice to support some more file formats.

Add locale support for error messages.

Documentation should probably be in the SGML DocBook format.

Thread-safe error handling would be nice.

Whenever a compression format is requested, the library should scan
through /usr/lib/audiofile/*.so to see if any DSOs support the requested
format.
