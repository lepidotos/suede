If you're upgrading from a very old version of GTop and
get a crash, please try removing your ~/.gnome/gtop
before you file a bug report.

When reporting any bug reports, please include which
version of LibGTop you're using and your ~/.gnome/gtop file,
it's a lot easier for me to find and fix your bug if you
provide this information.

If you want to help me a bit with this, I'd kindly appreciate
it if you could have a short look at

    http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgtop.html

and make sure your problem is not already listed there under
"Critical tickets - outstanding" (you don't need to read all
the open bug reports there, the "Critical tickets" sections
should be enough).

Thanks,
Martin Baulig <baulig@suse.de>
