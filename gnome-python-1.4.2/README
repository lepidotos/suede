gnome-python -- Python bindings for GNOME
=========================================

Author: James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>

This is a set of bindings for the GNOME libraries for use with python.
The bindings contain a copy of pygtk, so you will not need to install
that separately.  It can be found at either:
  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnome-python/
  ftp://ftp.daa.com.au/pub/james/python/

You will need gnome-libs 1.2.1 or later installed on your system (the
newer the better).  Optionally, gnome-core 1.2.x and control-center
1.x can be used.  If they are detected, they add support for writing
panel applets and control center capplets respectively.

For some simple examples, look in the pygtk/examples or pygnome/examples
directory.


Compilation and Installation
============================

To compile gnome-python, you should be able just run './configure'
then 'make', and finally run 'make install' as root.  If configure
fails, it is you may have to pass some arguments to it.  To see what
srguments you might need, check the end of the output of './configure
--help'.  You will probably want to use one of --with-gnome, or make
sure that python and the gnome-config script are in your path.

If you get really weird configure errors, or compilation errors, I would
appreciate a bug report.
