gnome-python-1.4.2:  3-January-2002
	- numerous pygtk bug fixes.
	- switched over to autoconf-2.52/automake-1.5.
	- some errors that caused crashes have been fixed by changes in
	  the code generator.
	- small bug fixes.

gnome-python-1.4.1:  23-April-2001
	- updates to gtkhtml widget.
	- pygtk updates (gdkpixbuf module, various bug fixes, install
	  code generator).
	- updated spec file to separate out devel portion of package.

gnome-python-1.4.0:  16-February-2001
	- adds support for more panel applet APIs.
	- update to work with latest gtkhtml.
	- various bug fixes.

gnome-python-1.0.53:  7-April-2000
	- switched over to using the CVS version of automake rather than
	  my `pyautomake' patches, as CVS automake now has the python
	  support integrated.  Libtool is now used to build the extensions,
	  so if there are problems on your platform, it is a libtool
	  problem :)
	- Various fixes by Frederic Gorby.
	- other typo fixes.

gnome-python-1.0.52:  13-March-2000
	- hopefully fixed the gettext.py module for big endian machines.
	- fixed small GnomeMDIGenericChild wrapper problem (from Federic
	  Gorby)
	- small GnomeUIInfo handling bug fixed (again from Federic).

gnome-python-1.0.51:  16-February-2000
	- gnome-python now requires python >= 1.5.2, as it uses the 'N'
	  format tag for PyArg_ParseTuple.
	- This release contains a lot of reference leak fixes.  Matt Wilson
	  did a lot of work fixing bugs in this release (thanks).
	- There is some support for the gtkhtml widget available if
	  configure is passed the --with-gtkhtml argument.
	- Various other bugs have been fixed, and features added.  See the
	  ChangeLog for details.

gnome-python-1.0.40: 30-September-1999
	- The version number on this release is merely to give an idea of
	  which versions of gnome-libs it is designed to work with.
	- Added _gladegnome module, which is detected by libglade in pygtk,
	  and if found will load the gnome portion of libglade (you will
	  still need to import gnome.ui though).
	- Added GnomeDruid support.
	- Added newer ZvtTerm methods.

gnome-python-1.0.4: 9-August-1999
	- All the fixes in pygtk, including more threading fixups.
	- fixed up gettext.py so that it is a little smarter when deciding
	  which language to pick for a message catalog.
	- Added a few more wrapper functions to gnome.ui, and fixed the
	  wrappers of a few others.

gnome-python-1.0.3: 22-May-1999
	- Mainly bug fixes to the thread support in pygtk.
	- A small bug fix that allows you to use the GnomeCanvas after
	  having imported either gnome.applet or gnome.capplet.
	- A small change to take into account the change in the
	  gtk_dialog_cauldron API.  This also means that gnome-python-1.0.3
	  will not compile without gnome-libs-1.0.9 or later.

gnome-python-1.0.2: 25-April-1999
	- pygtk now includes thread support (if python was compiled with
	  thread support enabled, of course).
	- Added gnome.applet and gnome.capplet modules.
	- Should not crash when looking up unknown string keys, when you
	  don't give a default, or checking for a canvas item where there
	  is none.

gnome-python-0.100: 24-February-1999
	- Some more functions will accept None in place of strings in some
	  cases.
	- ZVT wrapper should link correctly now.

gnome-python-0.99: 9-February-1999
	- updated to pre-1.0 snapshots of GNOME.
	- See changelogs for full details.

gnome-python-SNAP-981129:
	- Updated for the CVS as at 27th November 1998.
	- Added the GnomeIconEntry and GnomePixmapEntry classes.
	- Moved GtkLayout, GtkPlug and GtkSocket from pygnome to pygtk.
	- Added support for GdkImlibImage and GnomeCanvasPoints as arguments
	  to to signals and the like.  Note that this means you should be
	  able to use the GnomeCanvas{Image,Line,Polygon} items now.
        - You will have trouble with GnomeMDI stuff, since it has undergone
	  some changes that make it quite difficult to wrap.

gnome-python-SNAP-981123:
        - Updated for latest CVS snapshots of GNOME.
        - Reorganised to use automake.  Now the package contains pygtk, so
          only one download is required.  Note that the pygtk directory can
          be used separately, after rerunning automake.
        - Changed over to the new code generation system, as in pygtk.
        - Made some changes to the GnomeUIInfo stuff.  Now there is an extra
          element in the UIInfo tuples.  After the callback item, there is now
          a use_data tuple item, that holds extra arguments for the callback.
        - Now popup menus are working.

pygnome-0.2.3:  18-October-1998
        - Updated to work with gnome-libs-0.30.1.  (Which requires gtk+-1.1.2,
          so you will need pygtk-0.5.3)
        - Fixed a small bug in gtkcauldron.i that would cause a segfault if
          no button was pressed in the dialog.
        - Added gnome-scores constructor, which I had left out for some
          reason.
        - Added gnome-metadata code (in gnome.metadata module).
        - Added new widgets GnomeColorPicker and GnomeDEntryEdit.  The
          GnomeUIInfo based popup menu generator will probably not work
          because that code has some weirdness in it.
        - Removed gtktty code (it was also removed from gnome-libs.  If you
          need it, a copy from a previous version of pygnome will do).
        - There is no libgnorba support (without ORBit bindings, it is pretty
          useless).
        - Added the option flags for gtk-cauldron code (I missed these earlier)

pygnome-0.2.2:  31-August-1998
        - Added support for the GnomeStock widget (as opposed to the
          GnomeStockPixmapWidget widget).  This will allow pygnome to compile
          against gnome-libs-0.27

pygnome-0.2.1:  18-August-1998
        - Updated for gnome-libs-0.25/0.26 (Drooling Macaque).  You will
          require GTK+-1.1.1 and pygtk >= 0.5.0 for this version to work.
        - Added support for giving enumeration values as strings.
        - Fixed the dialog_cauldron stuff.  It should now work mostly.
        - Added support for things only available for GTK v1.1.  That is
          support for the GnomeCanvas and the GnomeApp.create_popup stuff
        - Added support for the GnomeCanvas.  Creation of items on the canvas
          is achieved by calling the new_item method of the GnomeCanvasGroup.
          the first argument is the type of item (eg 'rect', 'text'), and
          the rest of the arguments should be keyword arguments that are
          item dependent.

pygnome-0.2.0:  5-August-1998
        - Brought up to date with the July 28 snapshot.
        - Added support for GnomeMDI, GnomeMDIChild, GnomeAppBar, and others.
        - Added support for the dialog cauldron function (which is kind of
          like printf for GUIs -- cool :)

pygnome-0.1.3:  26-June-1998
        - Updated for GNOME v0.20
        - Added support for GnomeLamp, GnomeLess, GtkDial and GtkSpell widgets.
        - Added support for the dialog creation convenience routines.  They are
          represented as classes in gnome.ui, but in actual fact they don't
          define new types of GtkWidget's.
        - Fixed date on previous changelog entry :(
        - Added support for libzvt.  The wrapper module is gnome.zvt, and
          there is an example of using it in examples/zterm.py.
        - Added an example of using the gnome.tty module.  It is
          examples/gtktty.py.  It works the same as zterm.py, so you can
          compare the two before deciding on which one to use (I personally
          prefer zvt).  This example will only work if you also have pygtk
          0.4.4 or later.
        - Added module gettext.py.  It allows the use of GNU gettext message
          catalogs.  The doc string gives instructions about how to use
          existing catalogs, and how to use xgettext to generate new PO
          templates.
        - Updated the xmhtml module -- now the callback structures are decoded
          for the signal handlers.  I have updated examples/html_demo.py to
          reflect the update.  There is now a statusbar showing the currently
          selected link, and hyperlinks work. This change requires pygtk-0.4.4.
          The warnings printed are due to bugs in the gtk-xmhtml code, and
          I have submitted a patch that fixes the majority of them.

pygnome-0.1.2: 7-May-1998
        - Updated for a May 1st snapshot.
        - Added the gnome_config_private_* functions.
        - Added some missing GnomeIconList methods.
        - Updated the configure scripts, so that for Python 1.4, .py files
          go in $(prefix)/lib/python$(version), with shared modules in
          $(exec_prefix)/lib/python$(version)/sharedmodules, and with newer
          Python, .py files go in $(prefix)/lib/python$(version)/site-packages,
          and libraries in $(exec_prefix)/lib/python$(version)/site-packages.
        - Also, the "make install" option should actually work now.

pygnome-0.1.1: 27-April-1998
        - Updated to work with the April 21st snap shots off the redhat site.
          It should probably work, as long as no more large incompatible
          changes are made (unlikely).
        - Added support for GnomeDialog, GnomeDateEntry, GnomeCalculator and
          GtkCalendar widgets.
        - Fixed up icon list functions, so the whole lot actually compiles.
        - Added the gnome-mime support (although I get gnome_mime_init as
          an unresolved symbol ???).

pygnome-0.1.0:  22-April-1998
        - Initial release
        - This release has been coded from the 28th March, 1998 snapshot, so
          is not quite bleeding edge :), althogh I will probably update it to
          reflect the current state of gnome in a few days or so.
        - Includes support for most of libgnomeui, libgnome, libgtktty and
          libgtkxmhtml.
        - At the moment the argument parsing is a bit of a hack.  For any
          gnome specific arguments (eg session management), to be seen,
          they must be listed first.
