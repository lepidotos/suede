This directory contains examples of the use of the pyglade module, which can
be used for creating user interfaces from the .glade files created by the
GLADE UI builder.

Just put a glade file in this directory and run:
  ./glade.py filename.glade

The pyglade module should make it even easier to prototype interfaces in
python, since you can get it to look right, and act correctly when signals
get emitted, then generate a C skeleton for the UI.

You can find GLADE at http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~damon/builder/index.html
