><P
>      GNOME uses a special program, called ESD (the Enlightened Sound
      Daemon), as an intermediary between applications and sound
      card. ESD allows mixing sound from several applications, so that
      you can play a game and hear the sound effects while listening
      to an aduio CD. To hear any sound from GNOME applications, ESD
      must be running. Normally GNOME is configured so that ESD is
      started every time you login; if for some reason this is not so,
      click on the <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Main Menu</B
> button (the foot
      icon) and select
     <B

      and make sure that the option <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Enable sound server
      startup</B
></TT
> is enabled, so that the next time you login,
      ESD will be started. You can also start or stop ESD
      using the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Sound Monitor</TT
> applet as
      described below.
    </P
><P
>      Non-GNOME applications usually are not aware of ESD and need
      full control of the audio card --- they can not share audio card
      with other applications. This means with such applications, you
      can either have sound from GNOME or sound from non-GNOME
      application, but not both. In many cases, this means that you
      have to temporarily stop ESD to get sound from  non-GNOME
      applications (otherwise, you get error messages like
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Device /dev/dsp busy</B
>).

    You may control sound by turning ESD on or off by right-clicking
    on the applet and selecting <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Place Esound in
    standby</B
> or <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"

    respectively, as described below.

> &#8212; At any time, you will only
       have one of these three items, depending on whether ESD is
       running and what its status is. The first two menu items
       allow you to
       temporarily place ESD in standby and then resume ESD.
       This is useful if you have a sound application which is
       unable to work with ESD, but needs direct access to the
       sound device. The third allows you to start
       <TT

        the default theme is not a scope, this control does not do
        anything until you have modified the theme, as described
        below.) A value of 1 corresponds to time scale of 44 100
        pixels/second; value of X gives 44 100/X pixels/second. (These
        numbers appear because the standard for CD-quality audio
