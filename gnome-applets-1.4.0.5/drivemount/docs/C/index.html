>    Many file systems on Linux and Unix systems must be manually
    mounted and unmounted.  After a file system is mounted, you can
    read and write to it.  When you are finished with a file system,
    you should unmount it.  It is important to unmount removable
    drives, such as floppy disks and Zip disks,
    before removing the media, because Linux and Unix systems do not
    always write the changes made immediately.  They typically buffer
    the changes made to the disk in order to improve the speed of the
    system. Partitions on fixed drives, such as your hard drive, are
    typically mounted automatically when your computer boots and
    unmounted when it shuts down.  Removable media must be mounted and
    unmounted by hand, such as by using the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Drive
    Mount</TT
> applet.  
   </P
><P
>    The "root
    filesystem" is the main filesystem on your computer starting with
    "/" (root).  Other filesystems are associated with directories inside
    the root filesystem.  These are called "mount points", which are
    just empty directories.  When a filesystem is mounted, its
    contents appear inside this directory.  As an example, most
    systems create a mount point "/mnt/floppy" which is just an empty
    directory if your floppy drive is not mounted.  It contains
    the contents of your floppy if the floppy drive is mounted.

       This error occurs if you have a single device (in this case
       /dev/fd0) configured for multiple mount points and you try to
       mount one mount point while another one is already mounted.
       Having multiple mount points for a single device typically is
       not necessary.

       your system administrator. (This error
       occurs if your kernel is not properly configured to
       automatically mount the necessary kernel modules to read the
       device.)
