>      BCD stands for binary-coded decimal, a way of representing 
      normal denary (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) numbers as what programmers
      call "a set of binary numbers in four bits, thus removing the
      numbers A to F". If this doesn't make sense, just be aware
      that this clock is an amusement for programmers, and serves
      no really useful purpose.

>      It helps to read this clock upside-down! Start at the bottom and 
      read up to the top.
    </P
><P
>      The right-hand pair of columns shows the two digits of the seconds:
      the units on the right, the tens on the left. The centre pair of
      columns shows the two digits of the minutes. The left hand pair of
      columns shows the two digits of the hours.
    </P
><P
>      You add up the values of the illuminated LEDs in each column.
      You should get a number between zero to nine for each. That's
      the time.

      first before trying to follow the seconds, which are always

    </P

>     As an example, we can read the time in <A
HREF="index.html#JBCAPPLET-FIG"
>Figure 1 in the section called <I
>Jon's Binary Clock Applet</I
></A
>. Let's start with the hour.  The first
     column has only 1 LED on, in the second lowest position, so this
     gives us <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"2"</SPAN
> for the first digit of the hour.  The
     second column has no LEDs on, so we have a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"0"</SPAN
> for
     the second digit of the hour.  So the hour is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"20"</SPAN
>,
     or 8PM for people who like AM/PM notation.  Looking at the
     minutes, we have <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"0"</SPAN
> for the first digit, and
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"1"</SPAN
> for the second digit since only the bottom LED
     is lit.  This gives us "20:01" so far.  Lastly, we have the
     seconds.  For the first digit, we have the lowest two LED's
     lit. These have value 1 (for the lowest) and 2 (second lowest)
     for a total of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"3"</SPAN
>.  And the second column of the
     seconds has the top LED lit, with a value of
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"8"</SPAN
>. Thus, the time is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"20:01:38"</SPAN
>, or
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"8:01:38PM"</SPAN
>.

    move it to a horizonal panel, it changes size in the  horizontal
    panel. If you move it back to a vertical panel, it doesn't change
    size back, and forces the panel to widen itself.
