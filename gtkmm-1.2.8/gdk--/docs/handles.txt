Document still needs some work, but has basic ideas

Gdk Handles have the following behavior (GC is used for example)
  Construction, Destruction and Dynamic behavior:
    - They can be unconnected (uninitialized) for the following reasons
      * passed from a level where uninitialized objects exist
      * resource exhaustion
      * specifically created to be uninitialize
          Gdk_GC gc=Gdk_GC(0);
      * desired by user  (GDKMM_HANDLE_CONNECTED_ONLY not set)
          Gdk_GC gc;  

      If in doubt, the users should check if the handle is connected()
      even if they are not allowed to construct one.

      If GDKMM_HANDLE_CONNECTED_ONLY is set, all default contructors
      of handles shall be protected.  create(...) and free() methods
      are discuraged.
          Gdk_GC gc; // compile time error.

    - They will have a create() method available to initialize
      unconnected handles or connect a handle to a new remote object.
      The following will be equivent

        gc.create(...);  <==>  gc=Gdk_GC(...);

      (create is prefered for setting unconnected handles.)
      (* Font also will have an equivent method load(...))
 
    - They can be unconnected with the call free().  
      free() will unconnect the remote object, and if it was the
      last handle for the object, the object will be destroyed.
      It does nothing to an unconnected handle.

    - destruction of a handle will call free()

    - There should never be a need to allocate a dynamic handle.  
      The following are forbidden (read highly discuraged)

        Gdk_GC *gc=new Gdk_GC;
        delete gc;
      
  Operators:
    - operator =
      They will copy in a fashion similar to pointers
          gca=gcb;  <= gca now refers to the same remote object

      If it was connected, it will unconnect before copying.  

    - operator * 
      You can not get the contents of them as they
      are considered remote.  Expressly forbidden.

      (operator ->) same as operator *

    - operator ==
      True if both connect to the same remote object    
      or both are unconnected.

    - operator !=
      True is they are connected to different remote objects
 
    - operator (GdkGC)* ()
      All handles will provide an operator to revert to their 
      corresponding Gdk equivent.

      This shall be invarient
        Gdk_GC((GdkGC*)gc)==gc
    
      (meaning handles will never autoallocate.)
 
    - some objects will have an method copy which copys the
      charactoristics of one remote object to the other (on
      the remote side)  Both handles must be connected.

  Passing:
    - They shall be returned by value
       (return by reference only to expose a setable internal)

    - They shall always be passed by reference
       (value is not specifically excluded, but is never necessary
        so it shall be discuraged) 

    - Pass and return by pointer is forbidden.  Specifically disallowed
      (highly discuraged)

        int foo(Gdk_GC* gc);
        Gdk_GC* foo();
