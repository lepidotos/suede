These files can only be used with the win32 dist.  

The win32 dist is build by running the following commands on a unix station  
  sh autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make dist  (or place the tarball in the dist)
  make vc-dist

Notes on building (karl)
-------------------
The build set up is still quite poor.  Here was the directory
structure I used to build.  gnu was in the root C: directory.
Under that I placed a src directory with the binary distributions
of gtk+, glib and misc tools under that.  I then rearrange this
to match a unix /usr/include directory.  That meant moving the 
gtk and glib up to the src level and taking their config.h and
placing it at the directory level.   Libsigc++ was then installed
at this same level with its config in the src directory with
its headers and dlls under sigc++.  This then allowed me to
build the static library.

  gnu
    \
    + src
        \
        + glib
        + gtk
        + sigc++
        * sigc++config.h
        * gtkconfig.h
        * glibconfig.h
