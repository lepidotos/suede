graphical user interfaces. Gtk-- is distributed under GNU LGPL.
 
Highlights:
 * Typesafe, flexible signal framework (libsig++ library)
 * Extending the widget hierarchy via the regular C++ inheritance mechanism
 * Tracks closely development of gtk and provides equivalent C++ interface

       To FreeBSD Users

               To build Gtk--
                   1) ensure perl5 has been installed under 2.2.x.
                   2) ensure gmake has been installed.
                   3) ./configure
                   4) gmake
                   5) gmake install

       If you have gtk-config named other than gtk-config, also make
       sure set full path to the 'gtk-config' to environment variable
       GTK_CONFIG before run './configure'.

       For example, if you have gtk11d-config as gtk-config,
          env GTK_CONFIG=`which gtk11d-config` ./configure
       will do the trick.
