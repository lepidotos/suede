.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR medusa-searchd ,
which is normally run automatically from an init script
or crontab,
puts itself into the background
and begins listening on the local socket
.BR /tmp/medusa-search-server .
It must be run as root.
.LP
This seems to be the protocol:
.TP
C:
.B "gimme cookie"
\et
.I uid
\et
.I pid
\en
.TP
S:
.B "writing new cookie"
\en
.LP
If the
response for the server is, instead,
``\fBIndex Error\fP'' or ``\fBtimeout error\fP''
(with that capitalization),
then the session has failed and is closed.
.LP
Otherwise the client then tries to open the file
.BI /tmp/medusa-cookies/ uid_pid
and reads a single
.BR int ,
encoded in the local binary format, from it.
The ASCII representation of that
.B int
is the
.IR cookie .
.TP
C:
.I uid
space
.I pid
space
.I cookie
\et
.I search-uri
.LP
where
.I search-uri
is as documented in
.BR medusa-search-uri (7).
It does not seem to be terminated by a newline.
.TP
S:
.B Search URI OK
\en
.LP
If the server instead responds,
``\fBWhole Database Matches\fP'',
``\fBQuery returned no results\fP'',
``\fBSearch URI obsoletes index\fP'',
or
``\fBSearch URI syntax error\fP''
then the session is over.
.LP
Otherwise, the server sends a series of matching patchnames,
each terminated by a newline.
After the last the server sends
.TP
S:
.B End
\en
.LP
and closes the connection.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-\-named-index " "indexname"
Use socket
.BI /tmp/medusa-search-server- indexname
and index files
.BI "@MEDUSA_LOCALSTATEDIR@-" indextype-indexname
rather than the normal versions without the
``\fB\-\fP\fIindexname\fP''
suffix.
.TP
.B \-\-debug
Stops
.B medusa-searchd
from going into the background,
and causes it to send a
.SM SIGINT
signal to itself when printing warning messages.
