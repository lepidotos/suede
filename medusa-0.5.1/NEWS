This is the first version of medusa to be released.
Here is a quick summary of features:

--  Do searches over your hard drive for files that have particular
names, directories, owners, sizes, or mime types.

--  Find text files by content

-- Security features authenticate search requests, and the search
service ensures that only files that a user can read or know about are
returned.

--  A "stop list" allows selective indexing of files

--  Once an index is made, searches can be done even while making
subsequent indices

--  Locking system prevents corrupt databases

--  Command line interface "msearch", and gnome-vfs integration
