README for gnome-guile version 0.20
***********************************

These packages includes the glue code necessary to make GNOME
accesible from Guile so it provides a convenient interface for 
Scheme programmers to develop visual applications.

This program includes the Guile-gtk bindings for Gtk+.

Both projects were started by Marius Vollmer <mvo@zagadka.pin.de> and are
currently mantained by Ariel Rios <ariel@arcavia.com> and other intrepid
hackers around the world.

Gnome-guile is free software licensed under the GPL.

New versions of this package will be available from

    http://www.ping.de/sites/zagadka/guile-gtk/
or in
    http://linux.cem.itesm.mx/~ariel/download        (MEXICO)

You can also get at the most recent development sources thru the GNOME
CVS repository.  Guile-gtk is contained in the gnome-guile module.
See www.gnome.org for details.

Requirements:

guile 1.3.4
Gtk+ 1.2.7 or higher
Gnome libs 1.4 or higher
libglade 0.11 or higher

Acknowledgements
----------------

Many people have contributed to guile-gtk by now.  Many thanks to all
of them!  Please refer to the ChangeLog for details.

Bugs
----

The main aim still is robustness, with an eye towards completeness.  It
should not be possible to crash your program from Scheme.  Gnome-guile
has to cope with anything.  So if you find that your program crashes
and you think it is due to a bug in your Scheme code, you have
actually found a bug in gnome-guile or Gtk+.


Please report these bugs to the current maintainer, Ariel Rios,
<ariel@arcavia.com> or to the mailing list <guile-gtk@sourceware.cygnus.com>
