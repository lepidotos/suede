TODO items for guile-gtk
------------------------

For 1.0:

* Make metaspline do funky things.

* Code review.

* Cover gtk-1.2 as far as possible.

* Write some TeXinfo.

* Look into threading issues.

* Proper option parsing for build-guile-gtk.

* Allow inexact numbers for ints?

* Integrate guile-gtk into gnome-guile with autoconf support for
  people who don't have Gnome.

* Cover gnome-libs-1.0 as far as possible.

Later:

* Write a real high level toolkit based on these bindings.  Look into
  CLIM for this.
