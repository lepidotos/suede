When you want to hack on guile-gtk in the context of the gnome-guile
package you are of course very welcome, but please note the following:

Try to make sure that guile-gtk continues to compile outside of
gnome-guile.  That is, it should be possible to do a "make distcheck"
from the guile-gtk/ directory and get a working package.  This in turn
means that the build cruft in guile-gtk/ should not reference things
in ../macro, etc.
