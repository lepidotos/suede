Libsigc++ port for djgpp (gcc for dos).

This is a contributed Makefile and configure for compiling libsigc++ on 
djgpp.  To use copy Makefile.dj to Makefile in the sigc++ directory, then 
copy the the sigc++config.h into sigc++.  Type make to build the library.  
Copy all headers to a directory called sigc++ in your include path
and then include -lsigc to use.
