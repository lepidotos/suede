RISC OS Specific notes:
  To use include "sigc:signal_system.h" in your source. 
   (Use <> if you really want).

  Use "-Lsigc: -lsigc" in the command line to link.

If your filetypes aren't set properly, set 'stype,feb' to type Obey (FEB) 
and run it.

http://www.snowplains.org/~marble/libsigc++/
