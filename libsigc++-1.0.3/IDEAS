Macro Ideas
------------------
Need way to debug m4 files.  (#line statements)
(Partially working still needs work!)


Signal Ideas
------------------
VA argument signals?

Advanced signals with recursion controls? 


Do we have an equivelent of gtk_signal_handler_block_by_func()?

Example use: (from mail messages)
>  Changed loop between two text_entries.

>  In most cases you get away by testing if a value really changed in your

>  or impossible because you don't keep "local" copies of the value in your 
>  program), I use gtk_signal_handler_block_by_func().
